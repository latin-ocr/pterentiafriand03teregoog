Like the modern Italian, the Roman was gifted with
quickness of wit, great versatility, and vivid mimetic powers.
In common with other natione, the early Latius celebrated
festivals which were marked by dance and song. It is a
familiar fact that the Greek drama sprang from the songs
and dances which attended the worship of the god Diony-
sus, who in spring-time filled all nature with renewed life.
similarly, in Latium, besides the great annual festival of
victory, which in time came to be known as the Ludi
Romani, there were frequent celebratione in honor of the
rustic gods, a partial enumeration oi which will indicate
how largely they entered into the life of these primitive
peopic. Thus we have the Ambarvalia, Cerealia, Compitalia,
Consualia, Faunalia, Floralia, Fontinalia, Fornacalia, Libe-
ralia, Lupercalia, Meditrinalia, Opalia, Paganalia, Palilia,
Robigalia, Saturnalia, Terminalia, Vinalia, and Volcenalia¹

4. In what manner these festivals were celebrated may
be gethered from many passages in Latin writers. sibus,
a rustic procession with dance and song is mentioned in
connection with the rites >of Ceres:-

‘I'erque novas circum felix eat hostia irriges,
Omnis quam chorus et socii comitentur ovantes,
cremeram clamore vocent ln tecta; neque anta
Falcsm maturis quisquam supponat armils,
Quam Cereri torta redimitus tempora quercu

Det motus incompositos et carmina dicat.
(Verg. deora. 1. 345 n.)

And again, after describing the Attic Dionysia, Vergil tells
us how the ancient Latina honored Bacchus:—

Versibus incomptis ludunt risuque soluto,
Oraque corticibus sumunt horrenda cavatis,
Et te, Bacche, vocant per carmina laeta, tibique

Oscilla ex alta suspendunt mollia pinu.
(deora. 2. 386 ff.)
