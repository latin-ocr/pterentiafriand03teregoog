4⁵1. draehnmlsz the Attio drachma, like the Roman denarius,
was a silver eoin, equsl to six obols (seo 369), and worth about twenty
cente ol onr money. Greek words, involving such combinatione ol
consonante as clim, cm, clu, on, cl, and mu, suflered the insertion oi a
vowel, when flrst introduced into Latin. So δραχμή and drachuma,
’Δλκμήιη and Alcumena, τέχνη end leobino, ὄχνη and omnus, Ἀσκλη-
πιός and Aesculapius, pret and mino, eto. eat obsonetua: ei, ior
the deponent, Plaut Aul. 233, quid t llio uon poterat ele auo eones
obsonari filiai nuptiis? and Stich. 681.

454. potissumum: Spengel takes this word as emphabizing quem
and ie supported by Donatus, who makes it nn adjective, referring to
rank (dipultnte), as contrasted with aequalium, which refers to ege
(oemte). But Meissner more naturally makes it modily its neighbor
uuae, particularly lodan, my wedding-day, when Iought to invite all
my friends. quod dicendum hle stet: so sar oe 1 ought to spent
entre noue. Tne relative quod is here equivalent to quoad; hle, bere,
between ourselves, in the absence oi Pamphilus ; siet, a potential sub
innotive in a restrictive relative clause, as in quod sctum. Λ. h G.

455. perpetem nimium: very eporluyly, too much so. Some
editors take thie ae a tmesis for pernimium poree, but such a tmesio
seems to be oonflned to enses where an enclitic or ejaculation (eg.
mibi, hercle) Intervenes between per and the adverb. See 486.
non leudo: aparody on Simo's laudo (443).

4⁵6. commoni: a bousetbrust! uidero: see notes on insae-
uert't, 381; seceris, 397; and acciderit, 398. Davus thinks this an
opportune time to withdraw.
