Since the time of Bentley, it has been customary for
editors to assist the reader by marking the ictus, but only
in the alternate feet in those metres which the Greeks
measured by dipodies. In the line just quoted, there ars
really six ictuses, three of which are not marked, via, on
the syllables quoru, serf, andlit.1

1. Iarrmc.

64. For the iambus, υ !., any of the following fect may bs
substituted: (a) tribrach, υ <a υ ; (h) spondes, > ές (c) ana-
paest, wL3 (d) dactyl, >6 03 (r) proceleusmatic, wc υ.

In an acatalectic verse, however, the final foot must be a
pure iambus, or pyrrhic (υ υ), the last syllable, of course,
being indifferent (syllaba anceps).

65. lambis sermm (Trimeter arammeh—This is the
communest metra in Terence. All the plays open with it,
and in the Andria it is used in over five hundred verses.
The verse admits caesura, usually the penthemimeral, before
the long syllable or its equivalent in the third foot3 less
commonly the hepthemimeral, in a similar position in the
fourth foot. The latter caesura is often accornpanied hya
diaeresis after the second foot, or a secondary caesura in that
foot Many verses, however, have no well-defined caesura.

An anapaest does not immediately follow a dactyl. In
the proceleusmatie, which occurs most commonly in the
first foot, and perhaps never in the fifth, the third syllable,
bearing the ictus, must begin a word3 cf. 164. Lines
162-166 are scanned as follows:-

Factnrum magis id adeo mihi ut incommodet
Quam ut obsequatur gnato. Quapropter? Rogas?

¹Cf. Horace, Ars Post. atr:-

trimetris accrescere iusslt
nomcn iambeis, cum senos redderet ictus
primus ad extremum slmilis sihi.
