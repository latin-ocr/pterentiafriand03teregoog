850. Dr. Mtntnt Sa Tibi erpo. Da, Medo huc n· intra
Si. Qudsi epo quom duddan rupem: Mes. have erpo modo introii
(introi C). D has epo (underscored) before modo, aud urost editors
regard it as necessary iu the reconstructiou. However, as Spengel
says, iu D it is probably a mere repetition of erpo. Dz. deletes epo
after quasi, and before mule scens epo as an iambus, which cannot
be allowed. Bentley introduced tut (accepted hy l’rnpf. Wag. Meis.
Spen. and formerly blech), but the full forms of tre, as is shown hy
Eugelbreeht (ll't‘ener Studien, vol. v1. p. 2:32), are nowhere found in
Terence, and very rarely in Plautus. The line proposed by Eugei-
breeht himself, via:—

Mihin? Tibiergo. Ego ruodo ii iutro. Quasi ego quam dudum rogem,

faiis to give modo the emphasis here required by the context, butis
otherwise satisfactory enough. Pnobably, however. the best reading
is that now given by blech, who rejects the intruder epo, gives modo
its proper place under the ictus, aud supposes that huc, which corre·
sponde well with istic (840), has fallen out before ii.

857. tristis ueritas: O has ueritas ; other hiss. sceleritas, but in P

this appears andernes (Warren, dorcadum. es Para, vol. ΙΙΙ, p. 60),

aud inc as ”Auernos ‚¹ seueritas is niso given by Servius (ou Verg. Aea.
10. 012; Geor. 3. 81). Iu Neue Jahrb. ‚tilr Philoloyr‘e (1800), p. 205,
Fleck. brings forward a number of passages from Cicero, Tacitus,
Petronius, etc, to illustrate the corubiuation of tristis aud seuerus, or
of tristitie and seueritos; cf. (ep.) Cic. de Oret. 2. 5280, veltres seue·
rior et tristior. On the other haud, the very frequency of such com·
binations may account for ueritas being supplanted hy seueritas. lf
seueritas is accepted, we rnust either allow a sudden change to the
iambic metre, for tristis se· is not permissible, or we must read with
Flsclc, tristis est seueritas iu uolut. Furthermore, aceritus uras read
here by Nonius (p. 400, 20) ; tristis ueritus, ‘earnestuess of truth‚’ is
a striking aad appropriate expressiou; aud, lastly, we here need a
word which will be parallel in meaning, not to tristis, but to fides.
The reading ueritas is accepted by illota. Wag. Dz. spen.

858. equidem: Speu. gives quidem, contrary to the hias.

861. sttblierem: Fleck. (1851) introduced the form sublimen into
this passage, as well as Ad. 310, iu accordauce with the conclu-
sions of Riteebl, Rheiu. Muscam, 1850, p. 5563 cf. Ο. Ribbeck, Jahrb,
1858, p. 101. Klotz stood out unsuccessfully against sttblimeu,
which is generally accepted in tirese two Terentiau passages and ln
(ey.) Pleut. Men. 001, 007, 1004, 1052. Ribbeck substituted it for
