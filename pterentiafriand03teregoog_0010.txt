literary and linguistic problema of Latin comcdy.

Ibeg 10 ackncwledge the kindly interest shown in this
work by my former toacher, Professor Minton Warren of
Harvard 111111010113,011110111110111)1 the best Terentian scholar
in America. 1 am also deeply indebted 10 the general
editors, Professors 0. E. Bennett and J. (l. Rclfe, not only
for their careful reading of the procl-sheets, but also for
many suggestions and searching criticisms, of which Ι liave
taken full advantage. Το my friend and colleague, Pro
100001 Ε. Μ. Pease,I am grateful for no little advice and
assistance. To him is due the diagrarn which Ι 11010111-
serted on p. 156, and in many other ways his knowledge 01
