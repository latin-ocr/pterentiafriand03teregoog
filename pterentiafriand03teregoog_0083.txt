· (2) Τ110 verbsfunpor and 0001001010 the accusativ03 see
note 011 turmam abutitur (5).

(3) The use 01 1110 terminal accusative, illustrated by
00001101 and rats, is further exemplificd by vicinium (70).

(4) The ablativo with a gerundivo is used as an ablativa
01 circumstance3 01. mirando bono (938).

(5) Verbal nouus in 410 may take the construction of a
verb, as 10011 as 01 a noun. Thus exprobratio (44) governs a
dative3 111000 (202) 10 modified by an adverb3 and cautiost
(400) 10 equi-valent to carendum est.

(6) The subject accusative is often omitted with an iu-
finitive; 01. fatetrtr transtulisse (14), comperisse (145), etc.

(7) Questions usually subordinate are 011011 treated as
independent, and therefore retain their original mood; 01.
dic, quidest? (45); diceret, quid secl 2 (138).

(8) Τ110 indicative 10 011011 used instead 01 0 deliberative
subjunctive, as adeon(e) cd eum? (315). We also find the
indicative in a (1001010000, expressive 01 anticipation or
design, as in darn proficiscor (329); 11010 eaeo (714). Ιο 0
quoru (0000) causal clause, Terence generally has the indica
1100, but occasionally the subjunctive3 01. 488, 623, 944.

(9) Τ110 imperative subjunctive is freely used in 1110 pres-
ent tense, even 101111 0 definite subject, 01. quiescas (598),
1100000 (649).

(10) Ιο prohibitione, ne with the present imperative is
common. See 0010 00 ne nepo (384).

(11) 0000111000 contrary to laet are 01100 treated as con·
1103001. Hence 1110 present instead 01 a past tense of the
subjunctive, asin tu si lic sis (310) 3 ol. 914, 918.

(12) In regard to tenses, 00 lind 1110 present often used
instead ol the future, to express speedy movement3 cf. re-
vertor (485); 10000110 (594). It is also used for 0101010000,
as iu fit (244), fucis (322), odeo (315). For tho same reason,
the historical present is very common; 01. 128,133, 148,
etc.
