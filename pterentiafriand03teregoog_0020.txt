familiar to the Romans by Livius and his successore, comedy
was far the most popular. This species, which originated
in the revels connected with the naturegod Dionysus, had
passed through various stages of< development and evolved
avariety of literary forms. Two main lines of historical
development may be traced, one leading to the varicus forms
of Dorio or Siciliam comedy, the other to the rich field of
Ionio or Attio comedy. The former must have exercised
considerable influence upon the Roman drama, inasmuch as

into close contact with the Greeks, and in Sicily the ruins
of great theatres still testify to the large part played by the
drama in the sccial and intellectual life of those insular
Greeks. It was Attio comedy, however, upon which the
Roman was mainly built.

la The earliest historical species of Greek comedy known
is the Dorio Ferae, found in both the Peloponnesus aud in

characters, not unlike those in the Atellanae. From this
was developed the socalled Sicilian comedy, the best expo

where he flourished in the reign of Hiero (478-467 nc).
Epicharmus was the first to introduce two characters corn-

reflections on life and nature, which were not without
