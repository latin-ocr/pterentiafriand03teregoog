part in Plautus end Terence, and many of the variatione
· from classical prosody, found in these writers-are due to thes
influenee of accent, as contrasted with quantity.

52 Moreover, word-secent and verseaccent, or ictus (beat),
largely coincide in Plautus and Terence, and seldom clash,

‚ as in Vergil, in the important words of a verse. Thus we
never find in Terence an ictus like sequimur or pectora or
iudicione Indeed, the metrical ictuses of lines in comedy
coincide pretty closely with the ordinary accentuation of
words in everyday speech. Many words, we must remem-
ber, ere long enough to admit two arcente) eg. decreverunt,
decnimcttus, etc. Further, the eccent of a wor'd in a sentence
may be different from that which it bears when standing
by itself. 'Thus the subordinate words in a sentence may
unite with the more important ones to form word-groups,
'which then follow the ordinary rules of accentuation,
eg. potitis-quam (21), adcedam (29), apddcte (36). Among
such subordinate words² are: (1) enclitic particles,
as que, -ce, enim, ete, eg. immo enim (823); (2) the forms
of the verb esee,· (3) the indefinite and relative pronouns,
together with the possessive, personal, demonstrative, and
reflexive pronouns, when unemphatic, eg. quoe sese (792),
hoec quoe (794), noscent sua (23), uxorem cuo (177), edico
tibi (204), vae misero milri (302), inter se (220), Altio(am) ,
esde) hanc (221), (4) auxiliary verbs, eg. missos soce (833),
(5) unemphatie nouns, eg torcino) odolescentulo (828);

’ (6) prepositions and conjunctions, eg. in tempore (819),
ut iclbeam (741).

53. In words of four syllables, having the first three
short (υ υ υ ει), the verse ictus falls upon the first sylla·
ble in Plautus and (with exceptions) in Terence, eg.
sdor‘lius, coelicoli (16), relicuom (25), Glycerium, meterem.
