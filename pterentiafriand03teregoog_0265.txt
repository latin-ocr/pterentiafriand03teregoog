921. seraa .· thus A, followed by Dz. and now Fleck. Other Mas.
aad editors give seres. ,

922. dico. . . audierim: A, followed generally. spen. follows the
other Mes. in giving dici and audieris (also A as corrected).

92⁸. Ca. Nomen tam citui ΡΑ. Phania. Sr. Hem? Pr. Perii!
With the reading adopted in the text, contrusi the one generally
accepted: Cn. Nomen tam cito ethii ΡΛ. Hem, perii. (So Umpr.
Klotz, Dz. Spen.) The explanation given is that Crito is supposed to
hesitare, and Pamphilus, afraid that ho has forgotten the name, thinks
that this means ruin for himself. But even Pamphilus does not know
how much significance lies in the name, and therefore is not likely to
cry out peril because of a slight forgetfulness on Crito's part. We
may well believe, too, that Pamphilus himself could easily supply the
name, if it were essential, for he must often have heard it from
Glycerium.

Now Don. and all the Mas. (incl. A) have Phania after Crito’a
question, and two oi Bentley’s codices omit tibi, while a third has it
by second hand, where something (possibly Pam.) has been erased.
Α assigna hem perii to Crito, but, as corrected, to Simo. The rect
give nempern' to Chremes, and so Bent. Meis. and now Pleclr. Such
an arrangement occurred, it is true, to Donatus, who aske: An
Chromis eet dolentia eei ad eins mentionem cel arrad in ,liliam paene
peccarat i But 'this is improbable, ior the next utterances of Chremes
are those of joy : cf. 930-931.

The clew to the proper explanation of the passage is found ln Don.,
who says: Phania .· Hoc ita dicit Crito, at nemo arrdiret, scilicet adhuc
architana, an ipse ait ‚· and agonia: Hem: areret (μα’ pertarit Simonem
dicere, irascentem filio, Critonem snhrnonenti. As Bent. points out,
if no one could hear what Crito said, the hem perii would be abeurd.
But if, as the next note suggests, Pamphilus prompted Crito, we can
see why Simo should turn angrily upon hie son, and why then Pam·
philus, covered with confusion, should cry perii, on which word Don.
remarks: Hoc Pamphilus poet iracundiam patrie. Note that itis
Pamphilus who, in his impatience, again jogs Crito’s memory in 9432

930. aiebat .· both aiebam and aihum were used by Terence : cf. 932.
See Engelbrecht, &adia Terent, p. 57. Fleck. here reads aibat.

9³1. audiuere: Mes. show tam before the verb (audiere D G V),
bat Bent rejected it on the evidence of his Peterhouse Codex. uleclr
now returns to tam, reading crudire.

934. quiid credieeso Pleck. for aar· credie. A has qaid credie.

936. poste: this is F. Skutsch's conjecture ior postilla (Mes.) in
