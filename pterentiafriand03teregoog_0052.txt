xlvi INTRODUCTION.

why Terence introduced Charinus was the fear that it would
be too harsh¹ to leave Philumena without a husband
More probably, Terence merely wished to increase the eom·
plexity oi the plot. It is to be observed that he did not
introduce Philumena herself, as a modern dramatici would
certainly have done.

³6. As for contaminatio in the Andria, this is practieally
confined to the first scene of the play. The Epicurean sen·
timent found in staff. was taken, we are told, from Menan-
der’s Eumrch ,· but thc only complete scene which we know
te be due to contaminatio is the opening one This cemes
from Menander’s Perinthia, which in the first scene closely
resembled Menander’s nlndm'a. The latter, however, opened
with a soliloquy; the Perinthia, with a dialogus between
the old man and his wife. For the wife Terence substituted
the freedrnan Sosia, perhaps because to the Romans·it would
have seemed less natural to discuss with a metron a young
man’s amour. Sosia, it will be noticed, never appears again,
being merely wlrat the Greeks called a epicenon προτατικόν,
or introductory character, like Philotis and Syra in the

Hecyra, and Davus in the Phormio, and brought in mainly
to give clearness aud variety to the opening narrative.

to the degree of vivacity which distinguished them, into
materiae, stotonae, and miritae.² The uictoriae were full of

movement, the statariae were quiet in tone, and the mixtae
partook of both these features. The plays of Plautus are
ior the most part maiorica· those of Terence, ritr'etae.⁸

The Andria represents Terence’s normal style, and isa
sabate sainte. Only in two or three soenes is there much
lively action; ay. Act I, Scene 5, where Pamphilus is in
