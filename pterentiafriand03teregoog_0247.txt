Umpi. and Meis. read Sosio, et ou the authority oi Don. The words
Sosia . . . potestas are rejected by C. F. Hermamr (Rheiu. Marcum,

The passage has caused much trouble. The second line will not
acan, notwithstanding the attempts et making either tebertus a trisyl-
lable (Faernusuit. Klotz, Wag. Umpi.) or uiuendi a dissyllable
(Meis). Equally impossible is Bentley's libero or Spengel's conjec-
ture ot abi (accepted by Fleck.) oroi ut-In each case without a

clashes with the real apodosis in 55-59. Et or ac (Guyet and Bent.)
