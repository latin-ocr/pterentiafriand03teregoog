16. contuminsri: moeri, oi. Heooi. prol. lit-19:-

Nam quod rumores dhttrlemnt milivoli
linitis contaminisse Graecas, dim fecit
Peneis Latinam lictum hie esse id non neget
Neque se pigere et deinde iacturum autumat

'i'he word meone literoily brino coactior, mie, hut erloino is oiten
synonymous with spoilinp, polimina, and this is the usual significe-
tion oi the word. in Terence, the word involves a double meaning,
ior, ts used by his critice, it obviously implies spellinq, hut since
Terence would hardly admit the charge that he spoiled many Greek
plays (Hectit. 17), it is cleer thot he accepts the word in its neutral
sense So oontcoium end ooniopio ere used by Lucretius (3. 345, 740)
end cicero (de Fato, 3. 5, etc.) in the neutrai sense. A comedy that
tres turned into Latin without admixtum with another nes called
inisero (Hcoot. 4), the opposite, therefore, oi contaminato.

17. fucinum . . . intellegent: ie not tite net result of their

nihii: the forms nihil end nii ere interchengeoble. There was a
constent tendency to drop initiai or mediel h, which hed little pho-
netic value; ci. prendo, nemoris. In Plautus, nihii is always e
monosyiieble.

iectiorin ‹iiem ethoram invidiae noster. auctores: pelides. molleis.
These writers, especially Plautus, took many liberties with their origi-
nnis. Hence, perhaps, Horace’s criticism oi Plautus, secueris cedat an
renio rietschoio tolo (Epist. 2. l. 176).

20. uomentium: torsisse fremorem neci· is tire correct spelling
ior Terence. The authors nomed may or moy not heve practised
contaminatio, but they did show much ireeiiom in dealing with their
onginels. Terence claims thot his own practice oi contaminatio,
which is so severely denouneed by the critice, is but in accord with
this ireedom.
