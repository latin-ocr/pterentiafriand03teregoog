84. The aspirated consonante, ch, pli, and th, were un·
known in Terence's time, when they appeared simply as c,
p, and t, but for the sake of convenience editors retain them
in proper names and in a few other words taken from the
Greek, eg. Pamphilus, Charinus, Chremes, and ephebae (51).

Δ 85. Of peculiarities 01 (1001001101,1 the most important

found in the Andria are the following : -

(1) Greek words are declined according to both Greek and
Latin models; eg. Chremes, gen. Clarenaetis or Chremi ; acc.
0001010101,011100ιο111,0101000000,· voc. Chremes or Chreme
(see note on 247).

(2) Terence uses both deum and deornm as the genitive
plural 01 deus, the former always in interjectional phrases,
like pro deum fidem (246).

(3) Pronouns and adjectives which usually have -ms in
the genitive singular, occasionally have -i, as nulli censiti
(608);¹ similarly, soloe and merce occur as dative feminine
forms in other plays (Eam 1004; Plrorm. 9283 Hecct. 271).

(4) The dative preci, unknown in classical Latin, is found
in 601 and Phorm. 547.

(5) Nonns of the fourth declension have -uis in the geni-
tive, or -t, after the analogy of the second3 cf. cnroti, tmmdc‘

(365); anais (Heaut. 287).
