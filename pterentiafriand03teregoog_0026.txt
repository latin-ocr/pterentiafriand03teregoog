though less refined, writer. Plautus, we know, preferred
Philemon as a model, while the more fastidiens Terence
took most 01 his plays from Menander.¹
It is unfortunate that we 10 not possess acomplete comedy
01 Menander's, and cannot study at first hand his skill in
the construction 01 0 plot. But that he considered this 01
prime importance we may gether. from the plays 01 his
· imitator Terence. A story, too, is recorded that on one
occasion he said a certain play was almost ready, inasmuch
ae he had finished the plot aud had nothing to 10 but write
the verses. Moreover, Menander had the greatest reverence
for Euripides, who, in comparison with the other famous
tragedians of Greece, shows perhaps the greatest technical
skill in the wearing and unravelling 01 plots. The plots 01
Euripides abeund in surprises and complications; and if
these are characteristic 01 the Terentian plays, itis chiefly
due to the fact that Menander and the other writers 01 New
Comedy had studied in the school 01 Euripides. How much
these dramatists admired his art is well illustrated by oue
01 Philemon's characters who says that he would gladly
take his own 1110, 11 he were sure that by 00 doing he would
be brought face to face in the other world with Euripides.⁸
