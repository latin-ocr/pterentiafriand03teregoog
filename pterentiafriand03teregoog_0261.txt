arraunrx. 173

iurato ior the impossible toretmundum oi the Mes. Don. read taran-
dum, which, however, he lails to explain satisfactorily. I would punc·
tuate aiter opat eit, which is thus used without a complement, as in
736, and read iurcndamat. The ellipsis is due to the colloquial style,
and is certainly much easier than the awkward and indeed impossible
combination puio ut poesim. For a precisely similar vome-ending, see
line 152.

oppositae: on posint aa the perfect ol pone see Engelbrecht, Studio
Terent, p. lt.

⁷42. tu odpoet‘stl: see previous note. Spen. adherea to tun
posuisti 017.

753. ei. . . faxis: ior uerbum secere, cf. 178. So Dz. Spen.
and now Fleck. Other editors follow Don. in taking sueta eone
together.

754. Mr. mole dicia? DA. undeet? As early aa Don. it was
debated whether Davus does not speak throughout irom uerbum to
clare. There is little to choose between the two ways, but in such a
lively scene the more dialogue·there is, the better. I lollow the Mae.
and Eugr. Thus, too, Meis.

756. meretrix: the Mes. have both meretrix and ancillatam. One
ol the two nouns must be a gloss. Klotz, Spen. and Fleck. reject
meretrm, others ancillo. In view oi the sneer, 1 preier the alllteration
in multer meretrix rather than in Andeda ancillo. There is no special
iorce in the latter word

⁷⁷2. quoia cauea: Mss. have enine (quotae). As this is the only
instance in iourteen cases where the genitive oi qui isa dissyllable,
Brandt very plamibly conjectured quoia, which is accepted by Fleck.
See Engelbreeht, Studio Terent, p. 41.

783. This line is commonly read : —

Quis hie loquitur? O Chremes per tempus aduenis.

Bragmann, in a dissertation, “ Quemadmodum tn ianthino senario Ro·
raoni oeterer verborum areentur cam cerneris consociarert'nt” (Bonn,
1874), struck out Chremes and proposed ι- ’

Quia hic loquitur? Ο, per tempus mihi tu hic aduenis.

Fleck, comparing 345,p1ausibiyconjectures eupe before 0 Chremes.
Chreme ie the reading here oi all Mes. and Don. Aa ior the metrical
difficulties, see App. on intendite.

7⁸4. ain tn? hoec omnint: so Flock. The Mas. and Don. show
much uncertainty On an and oin, see Tenell on Cic. od Are. 4. t. l.
