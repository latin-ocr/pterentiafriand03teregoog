120. ιιι nii supra: colloquial brevity, so. esse possit ; cf. se. ius,
Eua. 427. In Cio. Ep. 14. 1. 1, and cd Ait. 13. 19. 3, the verb is ex·
pressed. Donatus styles the idiom ellipsis Terentiano, and states that
it did not meet with general approval. Note the srt with which the
father is made ιο acknowledge the beauty of Glycerium. After such
sconfession, vve do not expect very active opposition to his son's de-
sire to marry her.

121. qnia . . . praeter esurus: the repetition oi these words in
122 is inukeeping with the emphatic style oi Simc's narrative. 'Phe
second clause, too, repeating his former remark about the giri’s beauty,
illustretes the impression made upon Simo‘s mind, and also increases
our interest in Glycerium.

123. Ιιοιιοιιιι ac liberali: cemele ond pertesi. So coniugio iibe-
raii, tol. pedisequae: maitiae-women. Chrysis had become well
enough off to keep a number of servants ; see 791. In Athens it was
only the very poorest citizens who had no slaves.

125. percussit iiico animum : ot circe u thought flashed through
my mind. Percussit is practieally impersonal. The subject is latent
in the following words. ilico: literelly, on tlte spot, ie. immedi-

, οιο1ν. Th's distinctly local meaning is also found in Terence; oi.
Pione. 191. attat . . . est: Ab! there tce hove it! Note the
quantity αιιᾶι. hoc illud=rein' ἐκεῖνο (Aristophanes, Bonae, 1342);
ef. Verg. Aea. 4. oie, iios illuri, parcenao, suit 1 More numerous are
the cases where the ides in view is mors fully defined, as Cic. lie
Sertei. 20. 72, hoo iliud est quod Pisistrato tyranno o Solone respon·
sum est. Thus, similar ιο hoec illusi misericordia, is Verg. Aen.
3. 558, Nimirum hoec iiio Charybdis.

126. hine illae lacrumae: this expressim, here used literally,
became proverbial in the more general sense ci icc iilud est. Thus
Cicero, who is fond of synonyme, follows up the phrase, in pro Cael.
25. dl, with ei iaec cause est omnium scelerum cf. ilor. Epist. 1. 19.
41, where the poet explains why some critica decry him.

127. qnam timeo: quam alone with verbs is commoneat in con-
versationsl style. Cicero employs it not only iu his letters (es Ati.
li. 15. 3, qnam celim, and Ati. 12. 20. l), but occasionaliy in his
speeches, ss Phil. 2. 8. iti, quom id te condecebat!

128. procedit: the tense variatione in the verbs between procedit ·
and reiecit (136) are simply matri ceusu. sepulcrum: here of the .’ fi*
place, not of the burial, bnt οἶ ι-ιῗοῇῐιῇς oi the body; oi. the similar W*
tiss of sepelio. Note the force secured by brevity aud asyndeton.
