'ta Only one musician (tibicen) performed, his instrument
being the tibin, a word usually translated as flate, though
the instrument borea stronger resemblance to the modern
clarinet or oboe, and was also stronger and shriller than our
flute. It was provided with finger-heles, varying from five
to fifteen, had a cylindrical bore, and was blown by means
of a mouthpiece at the end.

In the accompaniment of Latin plays, the tibicen always
used two tibiae, or pipes, each with its own mouthpieoe. A
bandage (capistrum), passing over the mouth and cheeks oi
the performer and provided with holes to receive the mouth-
pieces, relieved the pressure of the pipes, and the musi-
cian was thus enabled to play on both pipes at the same
time. The melody of the music was played on the right-
hand pipe, the accompnniment, which was usually higher
than the melody‚ on the other.

The double pipes are described aa either porea or impares,-
i.e. either equal or uneqnal in length. In the latter case,
the longer pipe, which was held in the left hand, is repre-
sented in artas always curved at the end iarthest from the
mouth, and usually as terminating in a bell. The tibiae
imperes are frequently called Pterygion, aterm which, like
Lydiae, applicable to the tibiae pares, has reference to the
Greek musical modes. The tibiae peres were two straight
pipes of equal length. Of these, however, there were some
varieties. Thus, according to Donatus, the Andria was per-
formed tibiis peribus, dextris Ei sinistris, while the Mss.
mention the dnae dextrae in connection with the Eunuchus.
The seccanae, also pares, were perhaps shorter than the

Greek music. see Naumann’s History osMnsr'c, edited by Sir F. Goro
