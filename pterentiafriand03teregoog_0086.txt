noticed in Terence should doubtless he mentioned as charac-
teristic of colloquial Latin; but for an author aa early as
Terence it is often hard to draw the line between what is
colloquial and what is merely archaic. Early forms and
expressions are often preserved in later literature only in
colloquial style,-a fact which is well illustrated in the
Epietles of Cicero and his correspondents.

Where, however, we find alternative forms in Terence,
those which are generally used are, no doubt, the familiar Ι
forms of conversation, while the others, beingless colloquial,
are employed only for metrica] reasons. In Cicero’s Epistlee,
for example, the syncopated forms of tenses in the perfect
system of verbs arc far more frequent than in more formal
Latin. Similarly, verbal substantives in -tio, nomiae coedis
in -ιον and tric (cf. 232), and adjectives in crtus (cf. ioca-
lcrius, 7 82) are characteristic of colloquial diction. So, too,
in syntax, the use of the indicative in subordinate clauses
in indirect discourse andin deliberative questions is found
in the epistolary style, as is also the second person of the
imperative subjunctive in positive commands. The pro
nominal subject of an infinitivo is often omitted in Cicero’s
Epiatles.

(10) The use of lic for epo, asin 310, is similar to Horace's
colloquial emplcyment of noster in the Satires (2. 6. 48).
Other expressions which we may regard as distinctly collo·
quial are such verhal periphrases as irriserint soce (680, 833)
and effectum reddam (703, 864), the form mensae for
arcessere; the use of the affirmative particle -nc (245), for
which we may compare Horace, Sat. 1. 10. 21, and the fre·
quent use of audin (299), satin (749), cin (875, cf. Oic. od
Fam. 9. 21), and other forms compounded with the inter·
rogative particle -oa

(11) Playing upon words is a colloquial feature sparingly
used by Terence, as in amentium houd errantium (218); cf.
42, 338.
