THE PLOT CF m muare.

aa 'Phe Andria, or Mcid os Andros, talias its name from
the heroine Glycerium, who has had a peculiar history.

She was born in Athens, but iu her iniancy her father
Chremes, when about to take a journey into Asia, had left
her in charge of her uncle Phania Some time later, desir-
ing to escape from wariare, Phania set out with his niece
to join the absent Chremes. Their ship was wrecked off
Andros, but Phania and Pasibula, as she was then called,
being rescued, were hospitably received by a citizen of the
island, who, on Phania's death, which occurred shortly

. afterward, adopted the child, changed her name to Gly-
cerium, and brought her up with his own daughter Chrysis.
On her father's death, Chrysis went to Athens, accom-
panied by her reputed sister, now a very beautiful young
woman.

In Athens, at the house oi Chrysis, Pamphilus, son of
Simo, fell desperately in love with Glycerium. Airaid to
ask his fathers consent, he could not marry her, though he
treated her as his wife. In this attitude toward her he was
confirmed, when not long aiterward Chrysis, on her death-
bed, solemnly commended Glycerium to his care.

But the course of love was not to run smooth. Chremes
had a second daughter, named Philumena, horu since the
disappearance oi Pasibula, and as he was anxious to see
her well settled in life, he arranged with Simo a marriage
between his daughter and Pamphilus, oi whom he had
heard nothing but good reports.

A touching scene at the funeral of Chrysis rewealed to
Simo and the rest oi the world Pamphilus' affection for
Glycerium, whereuponâ€š much to Simo's disappointment,
Chremes broke off the proposed match Itis atthis point
that the action oi the play begins.
