sphere of his activity, scarcely atroce of his work survives.
In a list of ten comic poets of Rome, given by Volcatius sedi-
gitus (who lived about the beginning of the first century
mo), Ennius is assigned the last place, codsa antiquitatis.

StatiusCaecilius, an Insubrian Gaul, who was brought as a
prisoner of war to Rome and there liberated He became
an intimate friend of the poet Ennius, whom he is said to
have survived by only a year. Only fragments of his work
are extent, but ancient critice ranked him high in the order
of merit¹ Volcatius Sedigitus, indeed, sets him first in his
canon, while in Horaee's day Caecilius and Terence were
put ou a par,—

Vincere Caecilius gravitate, Terentius arte (Epist. 2. 1. 59).

As compared with Plautus, Caecilius evidently adhercd
more closely to his Greek models. An indication of this is
the fect that of the forty titles of his plays known to us, a
large majority are Greek, in the Terentian manner. Some
titles are given both in Latin and Greek, while only a few,
following the Plautina custom, are Latin only. To the con·
struction of the plot Caecilius pald great attention aud with
marked success.² We are told, ton, that he worked upon
the feelings with sentimental soenes, and in both of these
respecta we find Terence following in his footstcps. The
style of Caecilius, however, nnlike that of Terence, was
much criticised by Cicer0.³
