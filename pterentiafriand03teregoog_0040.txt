Scipionic circle were to be seen the fincst products of that
Hellenio civiliation which, by the end of the second Punic
war, had made an almost complete conquest of Romam
society:—

Graecla capta ferum rictorem cepit (Hor. apat. 2. 1. 156).

The Hellenizing oi Rome, as Mommsen has graphically
shown,l carried with it a host of erils; but it was not those
citizens who were thoroughly steeped in Greek thought, and
who, in their refined tastes, their love of learning, and their
literary pursuits, shewed the fairest fruits of Greek culture,
at whose door could be laid the charge of corrupting a
nation. On the contrary, these were the men who set
themselves the task of improving the publio taste and
thereby improving the public morals; and that this result
was actually accomplished rs probably illustrated best by
the history of the plays of Terence, which ‚emanating from
this select group of Hellenists‚ faithfully reflected the re-

,l fined thought and elegant style of the most polished Greek
'of later days. At first coldly received by the public, they
gradually won their way into popular favor, ands 1n a quar·
ter of a century after Terence’s deat h t,completely supplanted
the plays of the coarser, more faschal, more animated, more
Roman, but less artistic, Plautus.

· The Andria, Terence’s earliest play, was exhibited in
166 ao. In connection with it is told the interesting story
to which we hare already referred. The author offered his
play to the aediles, who directed him to take it to Caecilius

ior apprornl. The young poet presented himself to hie
censor when the latter was at dinncr. Being meanly clad,
he was told to sit down onabench, but after reading afew

lines was invited to share the conch of Caecilius, who listened
to the rest of the play with profound admiration.
