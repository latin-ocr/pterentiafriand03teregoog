57. alere ε used in apposition with stadium. ed philosophos:
with calmem Miueycat. The change oi construction is due ιο con-
versational ireedom. So, too, horum (tt) notwithstanding the singu-
lar qued. The leisure time oi young men oi means is here described
as devoted either to hersemanship and the chase or ιο study in the
schools oi philosophy. They would thus, according to their testes,
continue to follow one or the other oi the two main lines oi Athenian
education, γυμναστική and μουσική, the latter being a much wider term
than our ‘music’; ci. Flete, Rep. 3, especially ξ 412. α and h. Tm
passage here isvery like oue in Isocrateo, Areopagiticur, ξ 46, “The
Areopagites compelled citizens oi ample means to engage in horseman-
ship, gymnastics, hunting, and philosophy.” Evidently, then, no jolro
ia intended in the juxtaposition oi hunting dogs and philosophers.

58. horum = lterum rerum; A. a G. 188. e;13. 236. 2 ; G. 204. 4.
nihil: the accusative with studere occurs with neuter pronouns and

Lesas, Act 1. 2, ‘⁶ You have not been particular . . . you have done
nothing but lived in the general.”

istically Greek that Simo should be glad that his son followed no
pursuit, however innocent, to excess; μηδὲν dyas applies to philosophy
ss well as to sport. non lnlnrda: aot without reason. laiumais
the opposite oi iure.

61. adprime: gives a superlative sense ιο the adiective3 it is used
only in ante- and post-classical Latin. ut: sc. eyes (Dum). See
note on tt. The omission oi a subjunctive mood is uncommon in
classical Latin; ci. 120. nequid nlmim atranslatlon oi the pro-
verbial μηδὲν ἄγαν.

62. sle: this use oi sic in the sense oi talis, with esse and other
neuter verbs, is especially common in colloquial Latin ; ci. Pham. te,
sic est incenium Cic. Fam. 9. 9, rectissime suat omnia. perterre:
the historical infinitiva is a favorite construction with Terence.

63. quomque: ior the tmesis, ci. 263. In Hor. Ocres. i. 32. lt,
milti cumque salve rite vocanti, cumque stands independent oi any
relative pronoun, but it is generally regarded as a corruption. In

clined to suspect the reading. sese dedere: devoted himself.
