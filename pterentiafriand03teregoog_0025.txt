Pereoual and politica] satire, though by no means extinct,
have leit but few traces in th'e New Comedy, which is essen-
tially a comedy of manners, taking its characters from every-
day life and mildly caricaturing the follies of mankind in
general. These characters, however, resemble those of
Epicharmus, being generic, not individual, and including
such common types as the stem father, the wayward son,
the coaxing meretric, the learned cook, the hungry parasite,
and Sir Braggadochio, the captain of mercenary soldiers. A

works of New Comedy, which therefore contrast strikingly
with the plays oi Aristophanes in the ease with which they

most important in connection with Roman comedy, are
Menander, Philemon, Diphilus, Posidippus, Apollodorus,
and Philippides. Oi these, Menander, “the star oi the

of Alexis, whom we have already mentioned as a poet oi
the Middle Comedy. He was an Athenian who was born
in 342 nc, and died in his fiftysecond year. Theophrastus,
the author oi morosos, auertant worlr on socia] types, and
a pupil of Plato and Aristotle, was oue of his teachers, while
Epicurus, the philosopher, was, from boyhood, his most
intimate friend. The social circle in which Menander lived
was thus extremely favorable ior the development of his
literary genius, and his first play was brought out at the
early age of twenty, in the year of Demosthenes' death. The
total number of his plays is said to have been one hundred
and eight, but none oi these survive, except in disconnected
fragments. We are told that only eight times did he win
the priza of comedy, being less successim than his rival
