ACT Ι. schlin 2.

We must suppose that instead of following Sosia immediately, Simo
lingers behind to rafleot upon the situation. He remembers the dismay
shown by Davus on hearing of the approaohing wedding, and suspects
that the slave, working in the interests of Pamphilus, will do his best to
prevent it. At this moment Davus himself appears. ln the following
dialogus Simo threatens the slave with severe penaltios if be tries to
put any obstacles in his way.

1⁷³. lta: retrospective, referring bank to nou dubiumst, eto, like

175. mirabar, boo, eto: that there is considerable mental excite-
ment at this point is indicated by the metrioal variation in the scene.

afolmrse is not a subordinate question, but a real conditional clause.
Mirabar: mirum erat, and is therefore similar to such frequent ex-
pressions as longum 0101, difficile erat, por erut, eto, where the English
idiom requires the subjunctive. See B. 271. l. b ; -Α, h G. 311. o; G.
251. 1. The Latin, in fact, isa mixture of two ideas: ‘⁴ 1 was wondering
(mirabor) if matters would turn out thus,’' and “I should have been
surprised if matters had turned ont thus (abiret).” The English trans-
lation must ohoose between the two. et eri sempm, eto: aad srom
first to lortl secred tite outcome os my morter’s indiffereuoe. Davus
feared that this indifferenoe was only apparent, not real. See App.
