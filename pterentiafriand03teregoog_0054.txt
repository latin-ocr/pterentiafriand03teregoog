aeter, he will do nothing in excess. He isan easy-going
man, indulgent to his son, whose wolfare he earnestly
desires, and a good master to his slaves (36). Unfilial con-
duct cuts him to the quick (869), and deception he cannot
tolerate (902). For this he bitterly reproaches his son
(87211), and severely punishes his slave (865). He is no ⁴
match for cunning, and though, at one stage, he gets the
better of the wily Davus, yet he is ignorant of the fact, and
with ingenuous candor confesses to the slave his attempt to
take him in. Though usually polite and suave in his deal·
iugs with others, yet if his suspicions are aroused he can be
curt and even rude to strangers (908). His prevailing good·
temper (175), however, wins the day, if, notwithstanding
the disobedience of others, happy results are finally secured
(948, 956).

Chremes plays but a small part in the play. He is a
good friend to Simo, and a fairly good father to Philumena,
whom he wishes to see well married. Yet though he recog·
nizes the risle of experimenting with a daughters happiness,
he consents to her marriage with a man of doubtful char·
acter, in the hope of reforming her husband (572). His
gentle and for-giving disposition is seen in the way that he
pleads withan angry father for an offending son (868, 894,
901, 993).

Charinus, the friend of Pamphilus, figures only as the
lover of Philumena, to secure whom is the sum total of his
ambition (306). Mistrust of his friend is but a temporary
result of apparent treachery (643 ff.). He soon realizes the
true position of Pamphilus, whose unhappiness, he admits,
is equal to his own (702).

Crito is a good, honest sunl, who would not wrong Glyce

rium, even though the law is on his side. His character is
well described iu the line (857),-
