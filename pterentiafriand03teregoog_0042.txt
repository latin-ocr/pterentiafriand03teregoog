by the originale, admitted of considerable freedom both in -
verbal rendering¹ and in plotconstnrction. In the develop
ment oi Roman comedy, the tendency since the days of
,¹ Naevius and Plautus had been in the direction of acloser
’ imitation of the Greek originale. In the school of murinus,
' this tendency seems to have reached the extreme antithesis
tc the freedom in which Plautus indulged. Lanuvinus, we
are told,⁸ adhered so literaliy to his originale that he made
poor Latin plays out of good Greek ones, and this obscura
diiiyentia (Andr. prol. 21)-extreme precision with resulting
obscurity—is seized upon by Terence as the main charac-
teristic oi his opponent's school. To those who held with
Lanuvinus that a Greek original should he reproduced in
its integrity, without alterations, the practice adopted by
Terence, even in his earliest oomedy, oi combining soenes

from different originale, was naturally very offensive,-oon·
taminatio they called it in derision. Terence, however, justi-
fies the practice on the ground that it harmonizes with the
freedcm indulged in by his famous predecessore.⁸ Doubt
less Terenoe’s real aim in thus mixiug plays was to gain
variety of interest, curtail the lengthy speeehcs of Greek

1Α comparison ot the extant fragments ot Menander's plays and
the parallel passages in Terence shows many differences in the presen-
tation oi similar ideas; sec notes ou Andr. 427, 555, 611, 716, 805.

The view that the “poetical canon ” of Lanuvinus “was a close imi·
ration ot the earlier Latin comedians” will not bear examination.
Thus Ashmore, lutrod. to Adelphos p. xxxiii.

⁸The evidence at our disposal does not enable us to affirm that
Naevius and Plautus employed contaminatio in the speciiic sense lu
which the word is used in Terence; ci. Gilia, Acta Soc. Lips. 6. 310,
315. Plautus, oi course, showed neclegentio in reference to his origi-
nals, and, perhaps, all that Terence implies in Andria, prol. 20 and 21,
is that his use oi contaminatio was ot a piace with this asciscentis.
