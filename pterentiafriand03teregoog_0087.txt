(12) Proverbial sayings are characteristic of the sermo
cotidianam, as veodam in scirpo quaeris (941); cf. dictcmt ac
sectum (381). Except in his Epistles, Cicero commonly
accompanies these with a parenthetic clause, as ut erfone.

(13) Allitcration is a very common characteristic of every-
day speech, and is illustrated in English by such expressions
as ket aad kin, time aad tide, born arrd irredemptos] arrd
ceciliae. The early Latin writers are extremely fond of

s this device, but in classica] prose and poetry it is used only
for special effect. Aa compared with Plautus, Terence
indulges in alliteration quite sparingly, yet the popular ten-
dency is abundantly illustrated3 cf. 164, 426, 630, 671, 7 38,
798, 855, 888, 903, etc.
