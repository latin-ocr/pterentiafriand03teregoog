507-9. Here the preceding catalectic verse suggests a metrical
change, but the lines have caused much trouble. Editors generally ι
take them aa iambio. Dz. (ay.) gives thern thus :—

Sed nsso setius mox puerum huc deferent ante ostium ’
Id ego iarn nunc tibi, ere, renuntio futurum, ut sla sciens,
Ne tu hoc posterius dicas Daui iactum consilio aut dolis.

It happens that our sources show not a little uncertainty here and
there, In 507 Mas. have puerum deserent buo, but Eugr. deserent luo
puerum, and moa is found only in Don. and in one oi the two read·
ings in Β E. aad (aet) would be an easy insertion, perhaps influenced
by setina, and Fleck is probably right in reading the trochaic line,

nihilo setius mox puerum huc delerent anta ostium.

In 508 the erere κωπίω) oi C(bcre nunno, B) suggests that the

compound renuntio may be due to dittography, helped by ressontiu-
tnmst (501). D G, 15 Α XII, and Don. have the order renuntio ere,
but since Bentley most editors give erc renuntio, which order is neces
saryii the line is taken as iambio. Spengel gives thelina thus, but
with iam atino aiter renuntio-an uncalled-ior change. 11 nauticis
considered too uncertain, the readiug to be adopted is that given by
Fleck: —

ld ego iam nunc tibi renuntio, ere, futurum, ut sis aciens.

This is the reading oi tha Delphin edition and Stallbaum, but ln these
editions the lina was treated as iambio (tibi).

For 509 Mas. have ne to hoe mibi (miii boc, D G) posterius daos
Dani, etc. It is clear that both mibi and Doni cannot stand. Bent-
ley, who has been generally followed, struck out milti. The ailitem-
tion involved is certainly in iavor oi dicos Doni. Fleck, therefore,
omitting tn as well as mibi, gives the trochaic line ι- -

ne hoc posterius dicas Daui iactum consilio ant dolis.

But Skutsch (Hennes, vol. XXXII, laov, pp. 93-94) shows that thlsis
one oi the passages in Terence where the form poste should be restored.
Skutsch, however, faiis to see that the line should be trochaic, and
thereiore keeps miii, which he claime is an important word. With
this 1 cannot agree. We satisiy all necessary conditione ii we read ι -

ne tu hoc poste ditas Daui iactum consilio ant dolis.

The broken rhythm accords with the satirica] and hypocritical tone
