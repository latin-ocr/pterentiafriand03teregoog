ea and eat, in the enclitic forms 'a and br, frequently coalesce
vvith preceding words, especially adjectives and participles;
cf. molestarent (43), locutus=locatua es (202).

(11) Resides potest, Terence uses potis ert (437, 691). Β6-
sides tuli (as in 142,178, 188, 443), Terence uses the older
tetuli (808, 832). The latter is always used hy Plautus. In
789, at the end of the verse, we find attigas for the regular
attingas. The perfect of pono in Terence is posint, of. 729,

742, voa.

8⁷. Of adverbs in ter from adjectives in na, Terence has
only duriter (74). The form poste, corresponding to ante, is
to be read in 483, 509, and 936. Hoc for lsaud is common3
cf. 205, 460, etc.

· ea It istobe noticed that many peculiarities in deciension
and conjugation are found only at the close of a verse or its
equivalent, and are therefore due to metrical reasons. Thus,
in the case of perfect tenses which are commonly contracted,
the full forms are used regularly only at the close of a line;
cf. resolverint (494), hut decrerat (238). See note on 10.
The same principle is observed in the case of aiem, etc, as
compared with eim, etc.; the present subjunctive forms in
-r'm,· the infinitive form in -r'er,· the imperative focc; infieri
(792) as compared with frere, periculum beside periclum
(131); and dextera (734, 751) beside dectm (289).

6. Svnrux.

89. certain features in the syntax of Terence deserve
special notice.

(1) The partitive genitive with neuter pronouns is very
common, ae id aeyotr' (4), illud pondi (963).
