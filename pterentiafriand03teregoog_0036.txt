The persona] and political abusa, which in the Old Comedy
,naturally accompanies its grossness, we need not expect to
find in Plautus. The apparent absence oi strong convictione
in politice or anything else on the authors part sufficiently
accounts for this3 but ewen ir it had been otherwise, the fate
oi Naevius would probably have deterred his younger oon-
temporary from following in his footsteps. Plautus, how-
ever, may show the direct influence of Old (lomcdy in his
occasions] allusione to current events, in the frequent asides
addressed to the audience, and especially in the paradas&
which marks the Ortrculio. The trupioooomocdia Amphitmo
probably belongs to the sphere of Sicilian Comcdy.¹

It is claimed by Sellar that “in the large place assigned
to the ‘Cantica' which were accompanied by musio and
gesticulation,'' the Plautina plays show considerable traces
of the indigenous Saturae. Doubtless, these exerted some
influence, but it is highly probable that the cerdice arc the sur·
viving form of the old choral songs, which embodicd the
original lyric clement in Greek comedy. With the loss of
the chortis, this clement, instead of being concentrated,as
before, becomes more or less scattered through the dialogus.
A large portion of a play of Plautus or Terence was actually
sung, or at least accompanied by music, and in Plautus the
more reflective passages, especially in soliloquy·form, are
presented in a variety of distinctly lyrical matres. The
labored style, which often characterizes these in contraet
with the easy flow of the dialogus, is probably due to the
difficulty of adapting the thought to the Greek form. Ter·
enee, after one experiment, wisely abandoned the more
elaborate lyrical measures.²

The dialogue of Plautus is rich, full, and spontaneous in
