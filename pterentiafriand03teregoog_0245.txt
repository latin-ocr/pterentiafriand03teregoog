Umpienbach's edition (Berlin, 1870) furnishes the apparatuscriiicus
upon which every editor oi Terence must, for the present,⁸ 'base his
worlr. That thIs apparatus is by no means perfect, has been shown
hy Warren, llauler, and Schlee. Warren offers some correcti0ns ol
Umpienbach iu the American Journal os Pbiloiopy, vol. ΙΙΙ, pp. 59 n,

corrections which he has made In the collation of the Parisinus do not

Besides Umpienbach’s work, there are many vaiuable editions oi
Terence, which an editor must careiully study. Oi the older ones,
by tar the most important is that oi the English Bentley (Cambridge,
1726; Amsterdam, 1727). Tine edition, rightly described by Schanz
as mentemmentdm still a most valnable work, and no one, perhaps,
Isin a better position to appreciata the marvellous learning and critical
acumen oi Bichard Bentley than ie the editores Terence. The edition

bnt both thIs and the scholia oi Eugraphius are given in the edition by
Klotz (Leipslc, 1838-1839). FleckeIsen's Terence was first puhlished
iu1857, iu the Teubner series (Leipsic). A second edition appeared

shows a remarkable number oi textual differences. Very valuable is
