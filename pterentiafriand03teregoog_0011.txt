1. Before Greek civilization, with its wonderfulliterature,
became known to the Romans, this people can hardly be
said to have had any literature of its own. History, it is
true, was represented by bald chronicles, oratory foundanurs·
ery in the courts and in politica] contests, and even verse was
composed for religious ceremoniah as well as lor feasts and
funerals3 but such scanty specimens as survive from early
times fully support the view that the first impulse toward
genuine literature in Rome carne from contact with Grecos.l

2 But it must not be supposed that the Romans had no
natural and original gift for literary creation. No nation
could have produced such splendid results through mere
imitation. Probablyit is in the field of prose that the
unaided Roman genius would have shown the best fruits of
its development, for the Roman character was essentially
practical and unimaginative. Even without Greek guid-
ance, substantiel results would undoubtedly have been
achieved in the literary spheres of jurisprudence, oratory,
history, and didactic writing.

³. Of poetical forms, the drama seems to have harmonized
best with the Roman character, and we find ample evidence
that the necessary elementa existed from which an Italian
literary drama—not perhaps of a high type—might have
been evolved without the aid of foreign influenoe.
