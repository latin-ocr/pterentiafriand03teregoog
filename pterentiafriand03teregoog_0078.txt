In place of ce· followed by r and e, the original no is re·
tained, as in noster, corto, adversarius, though ue· was prob·
ably coming in in Terence’s time.l For the later cuius, cni,
our, and cnm Terence uses quoius, quoi, quor, and quom ; and
similarly, for the syllables cue, crim, and cunt, Terence
uses onos, command quoru, eg. praequm, equom, relin-
quom.

82 In gerundo and gerundives of the third and fourth
conjugatious, n is frequently found, as wellas e; cf. seri-
bnndue (5) es well as scribendum (1). 80 we have u for later
i in lubet, lacrumo, and iu most superlatives‚ as optumus,
prosumus (but i efter r and n, as acerrimus and minimus,
and sometimes after l, as facillime as well as facillume, 65).

The substantivcs yrmtns and puoto retain their original y.

aa In words compoundcd with prepositions, Terence
does not, as a rule, assimilate the final consonant of the
prefix with the initial consonant of the simple word. In
certain consonante] combinations,¹ however, wo find assimi-
lation employed, as well as in certain worda in common use,
and in such compounds as are no longer felt as such.
