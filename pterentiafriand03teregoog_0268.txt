978. sapuere bac tn me ,· initis apud Glyceriumat riano: this ie the*
msding suggested by Dz, (adnotatio antica), and seems the best, in
view oi the Mea evidence and the neeesaities oi thecuae. Α reads
enuere nae nae intas a Glycerium nnnc (with apat, a correction ior a) ;

the rest have apud, with eat aiter nnnc. Two iacta to gulde us in
reconstruoting the line are: that intuo cannot possibly accompany
enuere, which would require intro, and that the word Glycerium is
to be accented on the first syllable. Hence, our choice seems to lie
between Dz.‘s suggestion, which 1 accept, and Spengel’e, which Dz.
has given in his text, viz :—

sequere hac me intro: intus apud Glyceridmst nunc.

This latter, however, isredundant in thought, while the former
really departs irom Α only in the introduction oi tn, a slight but
eiiective addition, in view oi the contrast it makes with tn Daue.

981. restat: so tuost editors, ioilowiugh and γ. Spengel atmngely
follows the t group and Don, in reading restat.

In several minor Mse. oi Terence there is iound an additional scene
at the end oi this play, the subiect oi which is the betrothai oi
Charinus¹ DomandEugnbothreiertothis scene,butbothareinciined·
to regard it aa spurious. It is very corrupt in a iew lines, and, unlike
any other iinal scene in Terence or Plautus, with the exception oi the
latter's Poenulus, which is similar to the Andria in having a second
ending, cioses in iambic trimeters. According ιο Greiieid, De Andriae
Terentianae Gemino Exitu (Dies. Halle, 1886), it is to be assigned to
the last century oi the Republic‚ when some oi the 'Plautiue prologues
were composed. It is probably the work oi some grammarian who
thought Charinus was disposed oi in too summary a iaehion. I
append the lines as given by Dz.

Pinnutnvs. curantve. Cannense. Divos.

ΡΑ. Te expectabam: est de tua re, qued agere ego tectim uolo.
Operam dedi, ne me esse oblitum dicas tuae gnatae alterae i
Tibi me opinor inuenisse dignum te atque ilia uirum.
