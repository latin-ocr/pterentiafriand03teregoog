producing some 01 the idiomatic features which he finds in
the language 01 his originale. He imports bodily Greek
words and phrases, and almost outdoes Aristophanes in
ooining extravagant patronymica and other derivativas, as
well as grotesque mouth-filling compounds to which the
Greek readily lenda itself.

But assuming that Terence, dimidiatas Menander} mirrors
most faithfully the tone and ensemtlc effect 01 the New
Comedy, we cannot suppose, in view 01 the great difference
which the 'most superficial reader must detect between him
and Plautus, that the earlier writer strictly confined himself
to any one field. We must, indeed, believe that in the
Plautina plays the author made use 01 all the dramatis
resources within his reach. His literary activity began
toward the end 01 the second Punic war, and it was shortly
01101211 aa, as we have seen,² that the Atellanae were
introduced into Rome. It 10 highly probable that these popu·
lar performances suggested to Plautus much 01 the broad
farce and audacious roguery which fill his plays. Horace,
who was no admirer 01 Plautus, calls him a very Dossennus,

Quantus sit Dossennus edacibus in parasitis (spise. 2. 1. 173),

and the nornen 110011 01 the author is plausibly derived from
another stockcharacter in the Atellan farce, viz. Maccus, tha
buffoon. The careless haste which Horace criticises in the
same passage-

Quam non adstricto percurrat pulpita socco -

is probably dne quite as much to the influence 01 inartistic
popular entertainments as to the sordid motive which
Horace imputes to Plautus,—

Gestit enim nummum in loculos demittere.

The verb percurrere, which Horace applies in such a depre
oiative way to Plautus, is curicusly similar in meaning to

mecam ²See§9.
