nrrurvnrx. 111

transposing to consiliis 11116. 116611, leaving 6111 with 616, makes
616 16611116 by reading snm nisna

616. nt credam: following Dom, Spengel omits 61. All others
retain 11.

619. ens: thus 1116616, 61161 Glossarium Terentianum, 261; others
hem.

625. 16616661, etc: 116 emendation of this line is necessary. See
Klots, Attremtsene Metrik, pp. 61, 18. The dactylic line is introduc·
tery to the cretic system. See lntrod. ξ 14.

630. 111 negando: Mes. and Don. have in denegando (D inde
negando). Spengel's mode 61 correctIng 16 1116 simplest, and we
accept 1116 in 1161611116. So Fleck, now. The compound denegantis
1161116633, 6116 6 reminiscence 61 168. Most editors have denegandi
616116, dueta 1116116.

663. 61 timent, etc: the thought is arepetition of 630 and 632,
61111 the line is therefore bracketed by most editors. However, lt natu·
16111 sums 611 the previous reflectione.

6³5-639. Ι give the lines, as arranged by Spengel (so Klotz,
Attremtecte Metrik, p. 407, and Fleck.).

647. nonne: Spengel, though retaining nonne 111238, rejects it
here. So Fleck. and Meis. In the rest 61 the line both Dz. and
Spen. (with sot forratis) follow Ρ C aa 1 have given it.

660. conflauit: Dou. has preserved the reading, the Mss. all giving
confecit, which spen. retains. The former 16 1116 111616 picturasque
word, for which confecit, due perhaps 16 ort, is a prosaic substitute.

661. me essedariorum: Μ66.,11616161111611116111, Don, aud so most
editors Spen. omitting ine has esse ductu-ran. ’1116161111 without
esse is most frequent in Terence. See Ρ6611616,Ι111169. 1616611161.
IV, p. 253.

sea-4. qais homo istnc, eta: all Μ66. 611611 interturbat before
16616611 16111, 6611 sctis scio before faisse (after iratos D G). These
tetrameters, however, are inserted in 1116 trimeter system without sui·
1161661 reason, and Bentley rightly rejected sotis scio with the gloss
interturbat. Spengel further rejects 611.

666. sactum 661 hoc: this, which is Bentley‘s reading (ex nostris
antiquiores omnes), is also the reading of P (Warren). Other Μ66.
11616 sactum hoc est, which is generally followed. For the repetition
Bentley also gare sectam est after the Peterhouse Codex. This makes
it uunecessary to insert o before scelus, 66 116 Spen. Dz. Fleck.

681. quem 6 me accepisti locam: thus Eugr. and all Μ66. (11161611-
ing Bentley'a vetustiores) except G, which has in onem me accepisti.
