an Andrian citizen, Crito, a cousin of Chrysis, who is
familiar with the early history of Glycerium, and leads
Chremes to recognize in her bis long-lost daughter Pasibula
Thus are removed all objections to her marriage with Pam-
philus, who, together.witb Davus, is restored to Simo's
favor.

somewhat intricate. The principa] cause of trouble lies in
ignorance as to the parentage of Glycerium, and there is much
dramatic irony in the altitude which her father and Simo

ently original with Terence. Donatus, in speaking of Chari-
nus and bis slave Byrria, at the opening of the second act,
says: ltus personas Terentius avldidt't fabulae, nom non sant
apud Menandrum. This is interesting, showing, as it does,
that Terence felt himself at liberty to enlarge the original
plot by adding not merely scenes from other plays, but also
characters of his own creation. Thougb Charinus is not
essential to the Andria, yet he appears in no less than six
scenas, and Byrria in two. Donatus thinks that the reason
