Terence practically confines himself tc the iambic and tro

ehaic measures. Only in the Aricina, his earliest play, does

he experiment slightly with some of the less common
' lyrical metres.¹

62. The iambic (υ -) and trochaic (. υ), as well as ana·
paestic (υ υ-), metres of Roman comedy take their strict
Latin names-eg. senariae, septenarius, ouercam-from
the number of individual feet which each line contains. In
Greek poetry, however, these measures are based upon unite
of dipodies, or combinatione of two feet, whence a line of
four feet is known es adimeter, one of six feet as atrimeter,
and so on. In an iambic dipody (rr-u-) the Greeks
allowed the substitution of a spondee (> .) or a dactyl
(> υ υ) for an iambus only in the first half, just as in a tro·
chalc dipody (.υ-υ) the corresponding substitutione of
spondeo and ·anapaest ( -) were allowed only in the
second half. The disregard of this rule, or the loss of
distinction between odd and even feet, constitutas the main
metrica} difference between Latin and Greek comedy. ln
Plautus and Terence, substitutione and resolutione are, with
certain exceptione, allowed in any foot.

63. In reading verse, a metrical sti-ess (ictuc murium)
is naturally laid upon particular syllables, in order to
make the rhythm perceptible to the ear. In iambic and
trochaic verse, this stress falls upon the long syllable of
ench foot, or upon the first of two short ones substituted
for it. In the latter case, the first of the resolved syllables,
as a rule, either begins a word or is wholly enclosed within
aword; cf. initiamur in the first line of the Andria:-

Poeta quom primum animum ad scribendum adpulit

¹The scansion of Aa. cll-613 ls very doubtful. These lines ara
usually taken 'as choriambic, but Fleckeisen is probably correct in
mgarding them as corrupt, and originally iambic and trachalo.
