had to sit on the bare ground. The level space between
the occec aud the proscaenium was reserved for officials,
senators, and other people of distinction. In 179 nc, a
small stage cf stone was erected near the temple of Apollo,
presumably for use in the ludi Apollinares ,· but though public
interest in the drama was now increasing, so that iu 174 ac.
the censors allowed the maintenance of a stage to bea
charge on state funde, yet in 155 n.c., shortly after the death
of Terence, we find that the senate, following the advice of
P. Scipio Nasica, prohibited the building of a permanent
stage. But thie victory for the old conservative spirit of
Rome was short-lived. In 145 ao. Mummius, in celebrating
his conquestos Greece, had plays performed in a complete
theatre, provided not only with stageplatform and walls,
but also with seats in the regular auditorium. Even this
structure was made only of wood, and was torn down after
the celebration. The first permanent theatra in Rome was
not erected until nearly a century later, when in 55 ac. the
stone theatre of Cn. Pompeius was dedicated,¹—a building
' capable, it is said, of accommodating forty thousand specta

lus, οἰ which imposing ruins still remain, was built in 13 mc.

simple. Artistic decoratione for the stage were introduced
in the aedileship of Claudius Pulcher (99 Β.ο.), and not
before 7 9 nc. was there a shifting of the soenes. The scene
in aTerentian play is invariably a street in Athens, show·
ing three houses. In the Andria, the contre house is Simo’s,
while on either side are those of Glycerium and Charinus.
The sidewalls did not extend as far as the scaena, and so
