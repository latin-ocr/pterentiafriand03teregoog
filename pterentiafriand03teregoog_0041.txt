THE DEVELOPMENT 01³ ROMAN COMEDY. xxxv

The Hecyra, first produced in 165 no, was poorly received,
and did not meet with success until its third presentation, ¹
in 160 rac. The Hcattton Timorunwnoe, or Selstormentor,
was first performed in 163 ao. ; the Eunuchus aud Phormio
belong to 161, and the Adelphoe to 160. In 11110 last year
Terence went to Greece, probably with the intention of
gaining further insight into the Greek life which was
depicted in his plays. Iu Greece he made translations of
anumber 01 Μο1101111010 plays, but in 159 00. died, ¹while
