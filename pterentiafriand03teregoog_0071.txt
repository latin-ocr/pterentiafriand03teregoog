2. Thoonem.

θα The proceleusmatic is not allowed by Terence as a
substitute for the trochee, Lo. Otherwise, any of the sub
stitutes allowed for the iambus in iambic verse may be em-
ployed in trocheis as well, the metrical ictus, however, being
always upon the first syllable of the foot.

69. Trochaic &mearum (Tetrameter Cateleetic), contain·
ing seven complete fect, and one that is incomplete. This,
next to the iambis senarius, is the commoneat matre in
Terence (212 lines in the Andria). Diaeresis generally
occurs after the fourth fect, which cannot then be a dactyl.
Sometimes the diaeresis comes at the end of the fifth foot,
aecompanied by another after the third, or by a caesura in
the third. The sevcnth foot is usually a pure trochee, but
is sometimes a tribrach. Lines 259 and 260 are thus
scanned:—

Aliquid facerem, ut hdo ne facerem. sed nunc quid primum exsequar?
Tot me inpediunt odrae, quae meum animum divorsae trahunt.

'm Trochalc octonarius (Tetremeter Acatelectlc).—This
is a rare measure in Terence, only four such lines occurring
in the And-ric, viz. 245, 247, 301, 305. substitutione are
freely allowed, even in the eighth foot. Diaeresis is usually
found after the fourth foot, which in that case must not
be a dactyl. Sometimes, however, a caesura occurs in the
fourth or fifth foot instead. The verse is employed by
Terence only in alternation with others. The scansion of
245 is as follows : —

Adeon hominem esse invenustum aut infelicem quemquam, ut ego
sum l
