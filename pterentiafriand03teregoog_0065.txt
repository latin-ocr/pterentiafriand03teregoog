racsonr. lix

All Latin words were once accented on the first syllable,
andsdcilfus (eg.) must represent the pronunciation which
still prevailed in the time of Plautus, but which in Ter-
ence's day was giving way to the later facilius, mullerem,
etc. Quadrisyllabic words with the scansion - υ υ aa usu-
ally take, in Terence, the ictus upon the second syllable,
eg. dissimili (11 0444112), but sometimes upon the first, eg.
0040000 (40); cf. 0000000000, aas. 374, Hac. 492, Aa, 040,
and qudcddqufdem, Andr. 487, 608, Hecut. 1064, Aa. 956.

50 Owing to the prominence naturally given to an
accented syllable, adjacent long syllables are often, in dra·
matic poetry, reduced to short ones. Hence the socalled
molbio luw¹ according to which a long syllable may be
shortened, when it is preceded by a short, and either pre-
ceded or followed by the accent of 0 word or word-grcup, or ⁵
by the verse-ictus. Thus ό - may become ό υ, and υ ..(4
may become υ υ {a The short syllable preceding the
shortened long must be a monosyllable or begin a word.
The long syllable which is shortened is usually (α) 0 mono
syllable, (b) the long syllable of an iambic word, or (0) the
first syllable of 0 polysyllabic word; least commonly (d) the
second syllable in a polysyllable. The only illustrations of
(d) found in the Andria are colriptdtt (944) and ooliptdtec
(960)· The following may serve 00 illustratione of tho
other cases:-

(α) et id armum, 42; 090 in portu, 480; sedhic Pdm·
philus, 462.

(6) dabit nemo, 3963 satin adnuo, 749.

(0) stn(e) invidia, 66, bcu(um) inoccatum, 466.

In the text, all cases of syllables shortened by the iambic
law are marked υ.

¹Called lambio, because the long syllable thus affected naturally
forms an iambus (υ ,) with the preceding short
