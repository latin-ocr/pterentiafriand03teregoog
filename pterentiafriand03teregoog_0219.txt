asked to put an infant (represented in the ancient illustrations as
naked) on the bare ground. ara: ie. the altar of Apollo, which in
other comedies (ef. Plaut. Mero. cio) is mentioned as standing before
the house. Apollo was the god of ways and streete (Ἀγυιεύς).
nerum: tire word is usedin Latin with both a general apd a
special application. It is given by Verg. Geory. 2. 131, in a list of
garden produce. More commonly it is applied, aa here, in a generic
way to leaves and boughs, such as myrtis, laurei, and olive, used to
decorate an altar. In the Greek original, according to Donatus,

’ must arcear thot 1 did not place it ltere, erni this I erich to (io with c

The full expression would be, et ito eye agerii, ut liquido poesim iurare.

liquido iuretur dicere possis.

Probably Davus meant to inform Simo theta babyhsd been laid at

from spreading neta in hunting. Davus, then, meant to decoy Simo
and Chremes.
