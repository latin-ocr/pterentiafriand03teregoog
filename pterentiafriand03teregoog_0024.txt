ished by one-half and its functione are limited; the scenio
accensorias are curtailed3 the parabatis is thrown out; the
audacity of persona] and politica] satire begins to disappear,
and caricatures of literary, philosophie, and social life become
prominent. Burlesques on mythology show that Middle
Comedy and Epicharmus had much in common. The names
of over iorty poets of this school survive, but only scanty
fragments of their work. of these writers, Alexis and

Comody has now almost lost the chorus, which comes to
be regarded as an alien clement and is practically limited in
its iunctione to dancing and the singing of interludes. The
prologue, which earlier signified all the play preceding the
entrance of the chorus, now follows the example set by
Euripides, and consists of a speech lying completely out·
side oi the dramatio action. The parabatis has entirely ἴ
disappeared‚ and tho cyon oan no longer be clearly recog·
nized. Further‚ the extravagant and audacioris tone of
earlier comedy has given way to refinement oi thought
and simplicity oi style. Grotesque caricature and broad
farce are no longer in keeping with the dignity of the
art. Above all, instead of the mere succession of loosely
connected scenos, we now find a carefully constructed
plot.
