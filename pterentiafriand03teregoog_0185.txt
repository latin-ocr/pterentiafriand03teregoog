270. quum: ef. note on 288.

272. quae mlhl, etc: when abe baa entrasted to me ber heort-
yeo, ber whole lise? When, deor to my conl abaco cll else, 1 lave
looked upon lter aa my wisc, eboli Ι, οω. Note the use of indicative
and subjunctive 1η these parallel relative clauses. ⁸⁴ The difference
between the ludicatlve and the subJ'unetive in euch clauses seems to
be that the indicative calls ω mind the fact without special reference
to its logical relation to the principal clause, while the subjunctive
bringa this relation lnto prominence.'’ (B. App. 400. 3.)

277. ut (se. aereor)= ne non. You moy be unable to suitbatnad
compulsiort

278. porro: moreooer. The word indicates that the three adjec-
tivea in this line are grouped together, spart from ignauum. To
these adJeetivea, according ω Donatus, correspond in chiaetie order
the three noune of 279. The ungrateful man feels no slianie ( pudor) ;
the churlish and inhumau man has no love for hls fellows (omcr);

the brutish man is not even affected by association with others '

(consuetedo). More probably, however, the correspondence ie less
artillclal than this, being merely due to the fertility of expression
namral in an animated and eloquent passage. Cicero, for instance,
is fond of the triple arrangement of synouynis; cf. Phil. 2. 5. 11,
Quid anim ego constitui, quid gessi, quid eyi nisi ex latrina ordinis
consilio, auctoritate, cernentia?

tire, for no certain case of the ablative witheleia occurs before
Lucretius, and it ls at all times very rare. Clam petrem, silium, etc,

normal.

288. rem: le. her property, rem familiarem.
