the original in Menander was not expressed interrogatirely.

Davus here states the principle of his modae operandi in the recent ·
scene, and then probably steps asida with Mysis ιο explain it more
fully. The two, we must suppose, engage in too earnest a conversa-

Introd. 5 45.

796. platea = πλατεῖα, an instance ol the shortening oi syllables,
