me uliquis, proposed by Podieslri (Quomodo Terentius iu Tetremetris
iambicis et 7100111011 Verborum Amemus cum Numerio Comeeiaoerit,
p. 14). Flecla also transposes prouisa from its place at the beginning
oi the line te that after Pamphilus, thus making the line trocheis. In
this we need not follow him.

959. eapropter: so Servius here (on Verg. Ilei. 7. 31). By adept-
ing 11 101 propterea (Mes.) Bentley brought harmony ont oi discord.
Umpi. preferred 10 keep propterea and change deorum into deum, but
the latter form is used by Terence only in such 1011111100 as (eg.) pre
deumfidem. Se Engelbreeht, Studia Terent, p. 18.

963. mallem: thus A, accepted by Bent. Umpf. and Fleck. All
othere give malim. The imperfect seems preferable, in view 01 opteou
The latter is used while Pamphilus is still pondering on the matter.
Davus appears before he has made up his mind, and mallem, therefore,
has reference 10 what mipht here beeri.

965. There leno new scene indicated here in A 01 the Mes. of the
γ group. Probably the omission is originally due to the necessity 01
economizing space, as the play draws to a close.

ODeue: Pleck. greatly improves the line by inserting the interjec-
tion, which thus throws the ictus 01 the second ioot on the first sylla·
ble 01 011. These interjectione are commonly omitted or inserted in
the Mss. In this verse (eg.) 0 is omitted by Α11101010 Pamphile,
while 11971 all Mes. wrongly insert 11101010 Charine.

967. sim: Mes. and Don So Bent Umpf. Spen. Dz. West ’
Other editors, including Fleck, read sum. 1 keep the subjunctive,
which involves a slight reproach 10 Pamphilus, who falls 10 realize .
Davus' misiortune as vividly as his own good luck.

969. illusorium meu : thus A, and rightly preferred by most editors
to the mle Glycerium 01 the other Mes. Note the ictus.

971. See Trans. 0111011101.Ρ117.Αο100.,101. XXX (18911), p. 12.

973. solus est: Mes, followed by Umpf. and Wag. The second
person, es, is read by Bent. (duo a uostris eum ceter. ed), aleo Meis.
spen. Dz. and now mech There is not sufficient reason 101 depart-
ing from the reading oi the Mes. It is true that 0 Greek proverb ran ε
“whom the gods love, dies young”; bnt 10 be loved 01 the gods did
not always imply such a fate. Otherwise, Antipho, when felicitated
by Geta, ab dis solue delipere, Antipho (Picum. 854), would have
received a doubtful compliment. The fitness 01 proverbe depende on
the point of view of the speaker. “ Happy is the wooing that's 1101
long a-doing‘’isin asenec contradictory 01 “Marry in haste and
repent 01 leisure.'’
