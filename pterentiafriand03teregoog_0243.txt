appended the name of a certain Calliopiue. Who Calliopiue wae, and
when he lived, are vexed quaetione3 bnt it ie novv agreed that all our
ldae. except A are deecended from a common anceetor, vvhleh gave
the text of Terence, ae revmd by calliopiue.

It ie commonly believed that the Mes. of the γ group are the pureet
reproeentativee of the Calliopian recension, vvhile those of the ι family,
though betraying the hand of Calliopine, are deseended from a Me.
prepared with the additional help of the commentariee of Donatus,
Set-vine, and Priscian. Aeliae Donatus, whoee valuable commentary
on Terence le extent, lived in the middle ofthe fourth century. Servius,

. who ie beet known ιο ue ae a commentator on Vergil, belonge to the
end of the earne century; and Priscian, the great grammarian, flour-
lehed ln the beginning oi the eixth century. The grammarian Eugra·

places him in the third century, and Konrad Braun² in the end of the
third or the beginning of the fourth. Dziatzko,⁸ Schlee, and othere,
however, aeeign him to the fifth century, end therefore euppoee him to
be later than Donatus.

Scholare have generally aeenmed that the ι group poeeeeeee a de-
cided enperlority over the γ family. Indead, Spengel ie the only
editor of Terence who coneletently gives the preference ιο P. The

, traditionnl and generally accepted view rvae ably combated by Pro-
feeeor Peaee, in a paper On the Relatice Volue es the Mea. os Terence,
publiehed ln the Transactiona os tlte American Philoloyieul Aeeocio·
tion for 1887, vol. XVIII. Baeing hie argumente on the apparatus
criticae furniehed by Umpfenbach, Professor Peaee proved, by care-
fnlly comparing the Mes. and counting the variante, that the impor-
tunce of the γ family had been seriouely underrated, that A more often
agreeevvith it than nith the ι family, and that far fewer errore had
crept lnto the archetype of the former than into that of the latter.

Even thoee editore who believe that more weight ehould be given
to the 8 than ιο the γ family do not live up ιο their theory. ln my
paperon Tite Text ostiae Andria os Terence⁴ 1 have proved, Ibelleve,

thatnm only Spengel, but aleo Dziatzko and Fleckeisen actually accept
