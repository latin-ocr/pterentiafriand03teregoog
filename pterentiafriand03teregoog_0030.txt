27. Germe Naevius wae a close contemporary of Livius,
ior he eerved in the first Punic war, and brought out his
suet play in 235 ac, when he was about thirty years of
age. Unlike Livius, he was of Latin etock, but as Gellius
speaks of the superbio Campona of his epitaph, it ie geu·
erally supposed that he was born iu Campania What first ,
directed his genius toward the drama was probably his
military experience in Sicily, where, as we have seen,¹
dramatic exhibitione formed an important interest in the
life of the Greek populatiou. Naevius was bold of speech,
and in the spirit of Aristophanes uudertoclr to assail in his
plays some oi the Roman nobles. Rome, however, was not
like Athens. The Metelli, who especially resented hie

attacks, had him thrown into prison (206 s.c.)-a circum-
stance to which Plautus allodes in his Miles, 211. He was
released at the instance of the tribunes of the plebs, but,

again offendiug, was compelled to retire to Utica, where he
died about 204 ac.

The fame of Naevius rests mainly on his epic poem, the
Bellum Punicum, a work conceived in a thoroughly national
spirit, which afterwards powerfully influenced both Ennius
and Vergil. It was written in the Saturnian measure,
doubtless because imported metres were thought to be inap
propriata to a patriotic poem.

The same strong national temper is seen in the fact that
Naevius invented a new lriud ol drama, the praetecta, which
dealt with subjecte from Roman history, such as hie Romu-
lus and his Clastidium, the latter celebrating the victory of
Marcellus over the Gauls in 222 ao. These, however, took
their form from the Greek.

Naevius wrote many tragediee and comedies. The latter
