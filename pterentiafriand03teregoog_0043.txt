comedy, and secure greater complexity of plot. It is obvi-
ous, however, that contaminatio could be employed only in
the case ol originals with similar plots. Terence admits
that he has employed contaminatio in connection with the
Andria, Eunuchus, and Adelphoe. In the case of the Adel»
phoa, the two plays drawn upon are by different poete,
Menander aud Diphilus. The Hecyra is perhaps similar, in
having a portion of Menander's Ἐπιτρέποντες engrafted upon
the Ἑκυρά of Apollodorus.¹

Our knowledge of Terence's practice 01 contaminatio is
gained from the prologues to his plays. These prologues
bear considerable resemblance to the purchases of Old
Comedy.² The latter, it is true, found a place in the body
oi the play,l while Terence’s prologus lies completely out
side ol the play proper. In both cases, however, the speaker
addresses the audience in the name of the poet, just as is
done in the modern prologue. The subjectmatter of the old
purchases, as is to be expected, is more varied than that of
the Terentiam prologue, for the former deal with topics of
both public and private interest, while Terence limite him·
sels to a discussion ol hostile criticism or of circumstances
attending the representation of his plays. The prologues
to the Hecyra explain the previous failures of that play, but
all the other prologues deal mainly with the strong opposi-
tion eucountered by the young poet. It is evident that
Terence was looked upon as an innovator, who was dis-
regardiug the canons set up by a school⁴ of criticism of
which Luscius Lanuvinus was the chief representative.

The contemporary criticism of Terence's art became more
