Σ INTRODUCTION.

was, in the best days of Roman comedy, used chiefly as su
modium. illinies, however, did not receive literary treat
ment until the later days oi the Republic. At that time
their subjectmatter was enlarged, and gradually they
absorbed or displaced all other forms of drama, and were
composed down to the latest period of the Empire.

small town in Campania, were brought from their Oscan
surroundings to Rome after the reductiora of Campania in
the second Punic war (2113.c.). The performers were
generally young patriciana, who wore masks and'spoke in

in his translation of the Odysaey, as did Naevius in his cpio
poem on the first Punic war, but Ennius and sueceeding
poets speak of it with contempt.

The precise nature of the Saturnian measure was dis·
puted among the Romans themselves. The grammarians,
who were familiar only with quantitative metues, tried to
explain it on the analogy of Greek measures, but only a few
