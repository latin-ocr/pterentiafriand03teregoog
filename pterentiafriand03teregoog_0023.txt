works of Cratinus and Eupolis, nothing remains beyond
â€™ scanty fragments, but the great Aristophanes (444-388 ao.)
is represented by eleven extant plays.

In comio power, the genius of Aristophanes has never
been surpassed. His fancy, rioting at will, turns everything
topsy-turry. His choristers assume the parts of plumaged
birds or fleeoy clouds, or ehant the oroak of frogs about
Charon's leaky boat. His wit embraces not only the states
men, soldiers, philosophers, and poets of his native land, but

of Athens laid in the dust.

the Grcat(&3613.o.),and includes two plays of Aristophanes,
the Ecdesiususue and the Plutus. This species serves asa .
transition from Old to New Comedy. The chorus is dimm-
