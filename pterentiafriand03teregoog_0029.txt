⁴ Only a few lines of these plays survive, but they are
enough to show that iu his dramas Livius employed Greek
iambic, trochaic, and cretio measures. In his earlier work,
atranslation of the Odyaeey, which was used in the schools
Α - of Rome as late as Horace’s boyhood,¹ Livius had eseayed
the native Saturnian measure, but it is evideut that he now
regarded this as quite inadequate for his purpose. Cicero¹
declares that the plays of Livius are not worthy of a second
reading. The old dramatist, however, should be respected
as the one who paved the way for Ennius and first set
Roman literature on the path it so long followed In his
own day he was very highly esteemed. In 207 no, he was
commissioued by the state to compose ahymn of interces-
sion to Juno,⁸ aud it was due to him that poete (scribae
histrionesque) for the first time received public recognition,
being allowed to form a guild aud hold meetings in the
temple of Minerva on the Aventine.
aa The comedies which Roman writers, following the
example of Livius, took from Greek sources, are known
either ae comoediae or as fabulae palliatae, from the Greek
palliam worn by the actors.⁴ This species flourished for
nearly a century. Its earlier representatives treated the
Greek originale with great freedom‚ and made many con-
cessions to popular taste, while the later writers took pride
in adhering more closely to the models choseu, andin faith-
fully reproducing their refinement of tone, elegance of style,
and artistic consistency.

⁴Slmllar1y,comedies in which the soenes and personages were
Roman, were styled togatae, or later tabernariae (from tubeae, a
chop), because of their more vulgar tone. The togatae, however,
belong to the century after Livius, and their best representatives
cre T. Quiuetlua Atta and L. Alranius.
