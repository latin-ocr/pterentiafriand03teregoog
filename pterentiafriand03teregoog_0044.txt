bitter and personal as fresh plays appeared, and to¹ this
criticism Terence shows himself very sensitive. His ill-

wishers —fsti malivoli— claimed that his plays were feeble
in sentiment and style, —

Tenui esse oratidne et scriptura levil (Phorm. t);

that Terence was an upstart in the literary profession, who
was dressed in borrowed plumes, —

Repente ad studium hunc se adplieaess masloum,
Amicum ingenio fretum, haud natura sua (Heaut. 23);

and finally, that he was guilty of plagiarism (Ean. 23 f).

In regard to the last count, itis interesting to learn that
this serious charge of fartum¹ has no reference to the Greek
originale employed, but only to earlier Latin poete. Pro-
fessional etiquette demanded that when a writer had turned
a Greek play into Latin, that play should be considered his
peerdiar property. To this charge Terence pleads ‘not
guilty,’ either claiming that he was ignorant of any pre-
vious use of the play, or proving that his own was entirely
new.

The story that Terence’s plays were either wholly or
partly composed by some of his noble friends, -

Nam qudd leti dicunt malivoli, homines nobilis
Hunc adiutare adsidueque una scribere (Ad. 15), -

was firmly believed by many ancient writers,³ mainly, we
may suppose, because it was precisely the kind of story that
Terence could not well refuta, inasmuch as it was favorable
