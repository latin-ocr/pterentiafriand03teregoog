lines could possibly lcnd color to the theory that Saturnian
verse depended on quantity alone. The opposite view, that
the measure is fundamentelly accentual, was apparently
held by Servius, who, in commentiug on Vergil, Georp.
2. 385, says of the Saturnian metra, qood ad rhythmum solum
culpmes componere consueverant.

The accentual theory is now generally accepted, aud is
certainly more satisfactory as a working principle. As it
has an important bearing ou the peculiarities of Plautus
aud Terence, it will be well to give it in brief.l

Like the metres of English verse, the Saturnian, instead
of being dependent on the quantity (long or short) of
syllables, was coutrolled by the accent of words. Each
line consisted of two porticus, the first of which regularly
contained three accents and seven syllables, the second, two
accents and six syllables. The initial syllable of every line
was accented. Words of four or more syllables admitted

two accents, primary and secondary. Alliteration was a very
common feature. The common type is illustrated by the
opening line of Livius' Odyssey,—

Virum mihi, camena, ΙΙ insece versutum,

or by the well-known line with which the Metelli threatened
Naevius,- .
Dabunt malum Metelli ΙΙ Nacvio poscae.

11. We have now considered briefly the elements of a
native drama, which are to be found in Rome, independent
of the literature imported from Greece. That these early
Italian entertainments not only paved the way for the
genuine drama, by developing a teste for scenio art among

the people‚ but even to a certain extent left their impress,
if not upon all Roman comedy, at least upon those plays
