19. The germ of Attis comedy is found in the Dionysiae
winus, the marry proeession of mummers, who, to the music
of the duta, sang and danced in honor of the god The word
comedy siguifies the comossoay, and was, no doubt, coiued at
Athens ou tho analogy of tragedy 3 but comedy proper did
not exist until to the masqueradiug comras was added an
actor. It is this actor who brings into union the Attio
Cornus and the Dorio Feros, and offers a satisfactory expla
nation of the tradition that a Megariau, one sasamon,

1 invented Attio comedy.¹

20. Comedy was first recognized offioially at Athens in
465 s.o.; and as tragedy had been, for years before, a state
frmction, it is natural that comedy should have been some
what assimilated in form to tragedy. However, there re
mained great differenoes between the two, and the structure
of Old comedy, as exemplified by its famous representative
Aristophanes, was too unique to serve as a permanent frame-
worlr for comedy. Besides the chorus, twice as large as in
tragedy, aud therefore favorable to a division into rival

· seruiohoruses, there was regularly au agon, or contest, in
which the actors engaged as disputants on some subject of
real or fictitious importance. Iu addition to tho oyen, there
was the parobasis, which was not unlike the Terentiau pro
logne, and in which the chorus-laadan, addressing the audi·
euce in the name of the poet, sets forth his views ou literary
questions, or on matters of public interest. As a rulo, the
plot comes practically to an eud when the paratoria is
reached, and tho rest of the play consiste of a series of

loosely connected soenes.
a The most fiourishing period of the Old Comedy was
that of the Peloponnesian War (431-404 uo). Of the

1Α briei but very scholarly account oi early Greek comedy is given
by Bernett iu ibe Greek Dromo (The Temple Primam, Maamillam
1899). The illustrations given on p. 51 show that the earliest actore
in Attio comedy resemble the elowus of Rhiuthou's moes.
