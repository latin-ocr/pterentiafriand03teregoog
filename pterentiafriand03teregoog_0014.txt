INTRODUCTION.

Fescennina per hunc inventa licentia rnorem
Versibus alternis opprobria nucina indit.

(Hor. Epist. 2. 1. 145.)

“Through this iashion came into segue the Fescennino license,
which in alteritate verso poured forth rustic taunts.”

a The Fescenniui rusus, to which Horace here refers, take
their name either from the town of Fescennium in Etruria,

or, more probably, from the fact that a symbol of life (susci-
aom) was often carried in procession in order toward off
the evil eye. Such aphailic symbol was in common use
among the Greeks, aud it is awell-known fact that the germ
. of Greek comedy is to be found in the rude phallio sougs
· sung in the Dionysiae festivities.¹ The Fescennino verses,
as Horace points out, gradually became charged with pcr-
sonal abuse and scurrility, so much so that their freedom
was restraincd by a law of the Twelve Tables. The torm,
however, continued to be used of bauteringaud abusive
verses of various kinds such as those shouted hythe sol-
diers in triumphal processionS, and more especially those
sung in marriage festivities. The latter, and possibly the
former as well, were responsiva in character.²
