arraunrx. 169

527. aare: so PC B 0 D²E and read by Bentley. Ipsus (D1 G B)
isread by most editors. Yet ipsc pactus is given by all Mea, includ-
ing A, in Heaut. 894. The forms are discussed hy Engelbrecht (Studia
Terent.. p. 35).

532. See Trana. ostde Amor. Phil. Asana, vol. XXX (1899),p.11.

536. ausculta parira,· et perid epo tc avelim, etc: most Mss. gave
paucis et quid epo tc, and most editors retain paucis, and either trans-
pose epo aud te, though this is the usual order, or omit the first et (so
spen. Dr. and hicela). But P and C give paucas, which points 1ο
an earlier pauca (as in B). Don. recognizes both paucis and pauco,
and Priscian read the accus. here.

549. quasi: thus most Mss. and editors. spen. and Fleek. give
quari ai in accordante with D and Don. So, too, Bentley's 15 A XII
(Warren).

559. redducunt: so most of the Mss. The evidence of M ie in
favor of the indicative (Schlee, p. 35). Fleck. reads redducam after
0² 13¹ li and Don. On the spelling redd, see Munro on Lacr. l. 228,
and Dr. on Plrorm. 86. '

560-561. 'I'he Mas. give et after consuetudine. See Appendix on
51. Fleck. now adopts Wagner’s conjecture, coaiupi eum liberalis, etc.

576. iprae: so all Mss. (not ipse), no doubt because of the ictus
(ipsda).

531. audin: the Mes. add tu iliam. Among recent editors only
Spengel has ventured to disregard Bentley’s proud spondeo postico
quietumsorc by retaining these words, thus recognizing a hypercata-
lectic tetrameter. Ritter and Klotz (after Erasmus) kept tu illum, but
struck out uxor.

536. haheo fam fldem: all the Mss. except 0¹ Oand P(Warren
in Amer. Joar. os Pau, vol. III, p. 60) show tihi.

591. On the forms of the perfect tense of irc for Terence, see
Engelbrecht in Wiener Studien, vol. VI (1884), pp. 216 ff.

592. audiam: Mss. have audio, but Don. gives audiam as evariant,
following Menander‘s rt δή τοτ’ ἀκούσω ; Bentley read audiam, and so
Fleclr. in last edition.

593. dicti .· so all Mes, and therefore Engelbrecht (Studio Terent..
p. 59) gives hem to this line, suggesting, however, an hiatus at the
change of speakers. I accept the alternative. Most editors read

Hem Ι Quid dixisti? See Introd. §59-

594. apparetur: all editors. except Spengel, accept this conjecture
oi Bentley’s for the Mes. apparentur. In Eua. 559, apparatur is
similarly used.
