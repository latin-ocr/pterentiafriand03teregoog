172 arranem.

'l'he latter is found also in Μ and Don. But as Faernus argues, the
explanation in Don. (omnin miii integra ct aulea redde, puelia tibi
tradidi consultare) would indicate that his reading was really restitue
locam. Schlee (p. 4) maintains that G gives the original reading,
which was altered by the auctor librorum P c, and afterwards etiarn
in antiquissimam D irrepsit. This is very improbable. All tbatG
can mean is, ‘restore the position into which you received me,¹ which
is really the opposite of what is intended, viz. ‘restore meto my
former position, which you altered’ Flecln reads restitue rna in quern
acceptati loram, but a oomparison of Phorm. 33, nebia reatitnit locum,
confirma our choioe.

682. Mas. give sociam. Ar iam hoc epea eat. Hem, aed mane,
concrepuit a Glycerio ortium. In G a Glycerio is. wanting. Bent.
drops bern and mane and inserts hinc after verb. So Dn, though
retaining hcm. Umpf. drops con· (so Meis), Fleck. both aed and con-.
Spen. cuts the line down to a trimeter by dropping opna eat and
a Glycerio. Wagner reads ab tatae, treating Glycerio as a gloss. Thia
is the easiest emendation Hem and mnne araboth given by Don.
Ostiam concrepuit or soree deponunt is the regular expression, and
ab with a pronoun is commonly added; cf. Ean. 1029, Phorm. 840,
Heaut. 173, Hcc. 521.

686. chem: so Bent. for Mes. hem, and accepted by Meis. Da
Fleck.

qnid id eat: the id omitted by Mes. Flaolc now reads quidnam eat.
Schlee (Wdlfflin‘s Arenio, vol. ΙΙΙ, p. tot) retains qnid eat, taking
the line aa an octonarius and scanning mibi.

691. potia eret: Ι hare adopted Engelbrecht’s coniectura (Stadia
Terent, p. 28) for the Msa. potuerat. In Ean. 113, where all Mas.
including h have potuerat, Bentley's conjecture potia erat is generally
accepted.

712. hnc sac ad: the Mes. show saca and so Umpf. Meis. Spem,
but elsewhere sace is found only at the end of a verse. Fac occurs
fifteen times before rowels; cf. 408, 483. llere, therefore, Engel-
brecht is right in restoring sac with Schubert.

me uenias: ao P c and “ duo ca nostrie uetustissimi '' (Bent.). So
Bent. and Spen. ; other Mes. and editors at neniae.

⁷13. Di. Ape, ueniam. Cn. etquid: ao Mas. Spengel (so Dz.
and Fleck.) prefers to give ei quid to Davus, who thus mocks Charinus.
Howevcr, the repetition 111 the mouth of Charinus ia also effective, and

I therefore adhere to the traditional ieading.
⁷28. iurendimat: almost all editors accept Bentley¹a coniectura
