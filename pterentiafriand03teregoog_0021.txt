Tua Davaaoeuau'r OF Roman COMEDY. xv

caricatured mythologioal legends, in accordanoe with the
merryandrew spirit of the primitive Dionysiae revels,
when rustic performers sang and danced through the vil·
leges, and clothed themselves in the skins oi beasts or
stained their faces with pigmenta, and thus assumed the
part of Satyrs, Fauno, or Sileni, the fabled attendants of‘
Dionysus.

1⁷. Another type of this Dorio or Sicilian comedy was
the socalled mimus, written in prose, in which were depicted
single soenes from daily life. This form vvas brought to
perfeetion by Sophron, who flourished in Syracuse a century
later than Epicharmus, and whose literary work appealed
strongly to Plato. We may form some idea of the attrac-
tive character of Sophron's minwa from the fifteenth idyl of
Theocritus, which is said to bo an imitationes Sophron’s
Isthmioaueoe. Metrioal aalma, composed by Herodes, au¹
Alexandrian writer, were discovered a few years ago in
Egypt.

la Still another form cf Dorio comedy is that which the
Romans called Rhinthonica, because developed by Rhinthon ·
of Tarentum (flor. 300 ac), and which, as being a per·
formance of elowns, was called Phlyaeea¹ In the Phlyaees,
the myths of tragedy were travestied, for which reason
Rhinthon's comedy is sometimes called ἱλαροτραγῳδία, ie.
troqieocomoedio. The Amphitruo of Plautus, which hasa
mythological plot, is thought by some to show Rhinthon’s
influenee.² .

The various forms of, Sieilian comedy, growing out of the
early Dorio Farcc, were without a chorus, for whatever song
or dance was required by the entertainment was frunished
by the actors themselves.

ῑφλύαε is a Dorio form of φλύαρος, e stlly elown.
