aa In addition to those already mentioned, a few other
cornio poets are included in the canon of Volcatius Sedigi-
tus,¹ but little is known about them. Turpilius, the seventh
on the list, is represented by thirteen titles, all in Greek.
He composed palliatae only in his earlier life; for half a
century before his death, in 103 aa, the productiori of
palliatae had ceased, and such of them as were afterward
exhibited were the stock plays of the old poete.²

Since we possess the works of only two comio poets of
Rome, it is impossible to determine how reasonable is the
verdict of Sedigitas, in whose judgment Terence deserves
only the sixth place of honor:—

Multos incertos certare hanc rem vidimus,
Palmam poetae comico cui deterant.

lium meoiudicio errorem dissolvam tibi,
Ut, eontra si quis sentiat, nil sentiat.
Caecilio palmam stello do mimico;

Plautus secundus fdcile exsuperat ceteram
Dein Naevius, qui fervet, pretio ln tdrtiost3
Si erit quod quana detur, dabitur Licinio.
Post insequi Licinium facio Atilium ;

In sexto consequetur hos Terentius ;
'lurpssius septimum, Trabea octavum cptinet3
Nono loco esse facile facio Luscium ;
Decimum sodo causa antiquitates lirnium.⁸
