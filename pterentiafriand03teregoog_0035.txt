another, properare, used in a line where the context shows
that the characteristic referred to meets with approval : —

Dicitur . . .
Plautus ad exemplar Siculi properare Epicharmi. (Epist. 2. l. ts.)

Here, in his rapidity of movement (the precise force is
doubtful), Plautus is s'aid to have taken Epicharmus as a

model. There is no reason to doubt this statement, but we
may also bear in mind that Epicharmus, with all his refine·
ment, was the representative of a dramatic field-Sicilian
comedy-which was “essentially burlesque‚''¹ being the
direct ontgrowth cf the rude Dorio farces.² If we are cor·-
rect in assuming the presence of a large native clement
in Plautiae comedy, it would be but natural that his plays,
quite apart from any consciens imitation, should in certain
respects resemble the comedies of Epicharmus.

One side of Plautus—the coarse, bantoring jests, indeo
orous demeancr, and apparent disregard for common moral·
ity which many of his plays exhibit—is best explained by't
the merry abendon aud unrestrained spirit of revehy which l
characterized the rustic festivals of the Romans. We have
already noticed⁸ the Fescennino lieentia, which Horace tells
us was so prominent a feature of these festivals, and which
was thought especially appropriate on the occasion of wed-
dings. The introduction of this element was sanctioned-if
any sanction were needed-by the precedent of Aristoph-
anes, in whose plays the Dionysiac revels explain much that
is pffensive to modern taste.⁴

⁴See 5 21. That Plautus occasionally had some regani ior decency
and good morals is seen from the Captivi, in which he takes credit for
composingaplay ad pudicos mores sodo, abi boni meliores flant. The
Captivi isremarkable in having no love plot and no female charac-
ters. The Trinummaa resembles it in tbe latter respect, while its
