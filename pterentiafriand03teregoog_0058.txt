the Mes. of Plautus and Terence. Α performance was regu-
larly continuone, but as intermissions were occasionally

· required for technical reasons, such as an actor's changing
his costume, or resting from his exertions‚ these pauses in
the action were filled in with flute music, at the discretiori
of the manager (cf. Plautus, Pseudolus, 571). The expres·
sion primo actu plocen, in the prologus to the Hecyra (39),
means no more than in primo salardo.

The Latin eomedies were first divided into acts by the
editors of the sixteenth century, who doubtless followed the
statements of Donatus, ep. .· llaec eliam ul celera huiuscemodi
poemata qni-nque arctas, lurbeot necesse est eboris divim a

which Donatus here indists is probably founded on the prin·
ciple laid down by Horace: —

Neve minor neu sit quinto productior actu
Fabula, quae posci vult et spectata reponi. (Ars Poet. 189.)

But Horace is dealing ‘only with tragedy‚ and is following

normal structure cl a Greek tragedy, which consisted of
three episodes, separated by choral songs, in addition to pro
¹logne and epilogue. Yet some Greek plays have as many
as six episodes. Ι
The word nctus is often used by Cicero of the parts of
plays, and as in one passage (Vera 2. 2. 6. 18) he speaks of
the quamue (tolvia he probably knew of the five-act division.
Howevcr, a triple division is more familiar‘to him, and in
one letter he urges his brother, now in the third and last
year of his office, to follow the example ol good poete and
carefnl actors, who make their third aet their very beet,
perfectissimus alque amantissimus (ad Q. Fr. 1. 1. 16. 46).
Probably in Cicero’s time it was the custom to observe three
regruar pauses in the action, and fill these with musical in-
