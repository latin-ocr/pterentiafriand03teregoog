taking his maribus as equivaleut to his moribus praedito (so Dora) and
comparing eum moribus notis eonvmunicare, Liv. 10. 22. 3.

398. alia: non read aliam, and so Bentley (whose English Mss.
howeverhsdalia), followed by Umpf. and Da, but alia seems decId·
edly preferable.

400. apud te ut sies, Mes, but ut is rightly omitted by Fleclc in
accordante with Don. and Glossarium Terentianum, 29 (Goetz, p. iv).

414. huna: so lise. Bent. pronounced this line spurious on the
ground that hunc refers to Pamphilus, who, however, has not left the
stage since hIs colloquy with Charinus. But hunc must refer to Simo.
Foflowing Bentley’s suggestion, Fleclt gives huc for hune, hut the
contrast which ipsium (415) implies is in favor of hunc.

434. nequeo quicquam nunc quidem: so Flech, who in substitut
ing nequeo for aeque (lies.) follows the plausible conjecture of Von
Winterfeld (Hermes, vol. XXXIII, p. 168). The words aeque quic-
quam nunc quidem which Spen. and Dz. give as e questIon to Simo
cannot bo explaiued satisfactorily ; quicquam demands a negative.

439. nram propter consuetudinem huiusce hospitae: the Mss. hare
propter hulusce hospitae consuetudinem. Most editors follow the con-
jecture of Erasmus, huiusce propter consuetudinem hospitae, which
violates the rule that in Plautus and Terence the forms of hie in —c and
-re occur only before vowels and h. Spengel conjectures propter (ne)
consuetudinem huiusce hospitae, given to Davus. Th. Birt (Bhein. Mu-
seum, vol. LIV, 1899, p. 216), proposes propter huiusne cons. hospitae.
The best correctIon (followedby Fleck.) is that of H. Sauppe, which
Iadopt. Num has been lost because of mun in the previous line.
Da's conjecture of etus before propter le ohjectionable, because no
pronoen is needed In view ottho preceding llll.

441. trosti: Flock. reads nostt'n after D, but tho evidence of Μ
goes to prove that nosti was the origInal reading of the D family (see
Schlee, p. 36). With the exception of Speu, editors place a mark
of interrogation after nosti.

442. edm rem reputnuit ula: before reputautt several Mss. have
recta, which is certainly a gloss on uia. It is omitted by 1³1c¹ 0,
and was not iu the text of Donatus (see note). Fleek, however, '
now retains it, reading id for eam rem. Draheim (Hermes, vol. XV,
p. 239) shows that iu the third foot of the senarius an iambic word is
permissible. So in this play erae (717), sorum (745), dabit (774),
Chreme (783), Crito (801). In all these cases except dabit (774)
Fleck. proposes a change. In 540 we have a spondaic word (gnatam)
taking this place.
