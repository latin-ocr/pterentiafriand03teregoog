Hennes, volt XXXII (1897), pp. 93-94; ci. notes in App. on 483, 509,
917. So in Ean. 4113, where d has poet continuo and the other Mas.
show postiae or pastea, Fleckeisen's poete is satisfactory, and hasbeen
confirmed by the Glossarium Terentianum (Goetz), 006. (See Dz. in
W'oifflin's Archiv, vol. 11, p. 189.) Here Spen. and Da read poetid;
Umpi. Wag. ami Meis. follow Lachmann with poet ibi,· while Fleck.
makes a violent change ιο tam uirituet uveam relinquere tic postilla
aune primam aridio.

939. Sr. ae istam, etc: 1 follow the Mes. in assigning the con·
gratulation to Simo. Spen. and Piscis, without sufficient reason, give
it to Crito. More natural, however, is it to give (as they do) eredo ιο
Chremes, and pater ιο Pamphilus, ιο whom the Mes. give both credo
antipater.

940. at mi anas scrupulas etiam restat: Mas. and most editors.
This gives a proceleusmatic in the third foot. spen. reads serapias,
and Fleck. alters to at serupulus mi etiam uuas restat.

941. istud: see Schlee, Scholia Terent, p. 20.

945. liene, Chremes, etc: Spengel retains noa patiar at the
beginning of this line. These words are not given by A, though
found in the other Mes. The repetition of the name Pasibula is
due ιο Luchs, who is followed by Meis. Dz. and now Fleck.
Formerly Fleek accepted the form Pasiphilo (conjectured by Bezzen-
berger and Keil), but with the rejection of aaa patiar he returns ιο
Pasibula.

946. audiui miliens: Fleck. accepts the proposui oi conr-adt (De
Versuam Terentiaaorum Structura, p. 23) ιο invent the Mss. order
miliens cimini. This slight change improves the line greatly.

951. mecrira: to avoid this ictus Fleck. inserts the imperative i
aitermecam.

95⁷. are aliquis sors putet: atroublesome line. Mss. heve aliquis
forsitan irie patet, Α C and P (Warren) showing forsitam, and V
omitting me. Umpi. Wag. Meis. follow G. Hermann in reading
aliquis me forsitan with patet beginning the next line. Both hera
and in Eua. 197, Bentley read ‚forsan for Mss. forsitan, but Haupt
(Hecates, vol. V, p. 176) shows that we cannot claim the form sorsaa
ior any writer earlier than Lucretius. In Heaut. 715, Bentley's raad-
ing sors ior Mss. sortasse is required by the metro, hence Spengel
(followed by Dz.) read here aliquis sore ave putet. Flosis„ who now
adopts sors in ail of the above mentioned passages, as wellas Paean.
717, objecta to aliquis constituting an independent foot with this ictus,

as contrary to the usage of Plautus and Terence lie therefore aecepts
