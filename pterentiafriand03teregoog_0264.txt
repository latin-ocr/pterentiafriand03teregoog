176 . urrunnun

the adjective even in such s passage es Verg. Geor. 1. 242, Hic vertex
nobis semper sublimis, or Aen. 2. 259; ll. 67. This view, so com-
monly held by scholare, isoverthrown by W. llerseus in a convinciug
article in Philolopus, vol. LV (1898), pp. 197-219. We can now ssiely
return ιο the reading sublimem, retaining the traditionsl order subli-
mem hunc intro rape.

864. ipo iam tc commbtum reddam: Dz. makes the verse iambic
hy scanning ἔρὸ. This cannot be admitted. Schlee suggests rape
before epo. Fleck. (see Neue Jatrb. su'r Philologie, 1899, p. 296)
makes a violent change to epo ti eotrtinuo mltum reddum. We must
accept the verse as a trochnic septenarius.

868. 0.- thus P (Warrsn).

888. From here to the end oi the play, with the exception of
993-912, the Bembinus (A) isavsilsbls.

892. binc duem: the order of A and I). Other Mss. give ciuem
hinc‚· so Klotz and Spen. Curiously enough in v. 908 hinc ciuemis
read by γ, while duem tineis there given byt (including Bentley’s
15 A XII).

894. eporediam? qnid epo acidiam: the second epo is original
in P C GE, aud a correction in A and D. It is retained by blech,
but rejected by most editore.

895. cqc dicat, sirio: this is the punctuation of Bsnt. Du. Spen.
Others give ape, dicct sino

898. banc amittere: Mss. have terre tris amittere (amittere, D).
Most editors retain uis, and read mittere. Flech. drops uis, and re-
tains amittere. It is easy ιο account for uie ss sn unnecessary repe·
thien, end amittere (= dimittere) is very common in Terence3 cf. =
Pborm. 141,178, 414.

908. Cu. llic. cn. Simo men quaesti? St. Ele taeter Mss.
are uncertain as ιο the distribution of the parts in this line. D Ε G
(so Klotz and Meis.) make Simo begin with men queuis? hut it seems
decidedly better to give this question ιο Crito, who has come out to
setisfy Simo's doubts. I therefore follow C, which ls the most estis-
iactory‚ and ls accepted by Bent. ng. Dr. Spen. In his second
edition Flech. reads: Cu. Hic Simost. Cn. Men qnaeris?

909. qua re: so Ο. Fleck. alone gives qua de rc of other Mes

(P C thus, qua (ἷὲ.)

917. ante: A (Umpf.'s addenda et temnenda, p. lxxxii). So
Skutsch in Hennes, vol. XXXII (1897), pp. 93-94. The common
reading is antebac.
