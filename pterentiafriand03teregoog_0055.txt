Davus, the fallea cervus, is probably the most interesting
character of the Andria. He is a bold and ingenious
schcmcr, an abettor in an evil course (192), very impertirent
to his master, and ready to do him an ill turn (162), yet not
without many good points. He is breve, and knowingly
runs the risk of severe penalties (210 ff.); he displays great
eagerness and activity (355); he is devoted to his masters
son, and, when his plans miscarry‚ he admits his defeat and
proposes the penalty due (621). In his enoounters with
Simo he shows' much cleverness in repartee, and his ability
to assume an air of injured innocense is very amusing (504).

Sosia, who is a merc foil for Simo in the opening scene,
hasbeen a faithful slave, and is now regarded as a safe con-
fidant. He merely echoes his patron's worda, throwing in
an occasional wisc saw.

Byrria, the confidential slave of Charinus, has alow mind,
and can be very impudent to his master (316, 428 ff.).
Mysis is a simple, kindly creature, who is as dull of compre·
hension as Davus is elever. She is devoted to her mistress,
and treats her with affectionate regard (685). Lesbia is said
to be careless and fond of tippling (229); after the fashion
of ber kind, she loves to gossip (459), and issues her orders
with a professional air. Glycerium, a modest, beautiful,
and affectionate girl, becomes known to us only through the
descriptione of others.

adapted to the modern stage. Some of its soenes are repro

has also been imitated by the Frencb dramatist, Michel
Baron, in his Andrieane, and by Sir Richard Steele <terh
