simple future might be employed. In nearly every case,
however, we lind that the perfect tense gives additional

force or precision. Thus ceperit (213), in the apodosis, gives
an air of assurance to the statement of future action. So

with videro (456). Invenerit (381) is expressive of instanta-
neous action. In fuero and peeeero (641), and restitueris
(tio), tho tcnse denotes a future resulting state.

tense of the main verb. Thus oportuit praescisse end com
manicatum (cesse) (239).
