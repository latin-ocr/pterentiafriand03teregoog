opening narrative, in which is set forth the position of affairs
at the outset of the play.

Scenes into which a musical element entered were of two
kinds. They were either (a) deolaimed in recitative style,
with flute aocompaniment, or (b) they were actually sung to
set tunes. Both of these kinds of soenes were known as
cantion The former (a) were composed either in iambic
octonarii, or in trochaio or iambis septenarii. The latter
(b) were distinotly lyrical soenes, composed in a variety of
metres, including not only the more unusual ones, such as
the cretio, bacehiao, and trochaic octonarii, but also those
mentioned in connection with (a) the merely recited
cantioa¹ Livius Andronicus introduced the custorn oi
having these lyrical cantica sung by a young slave, who stood
near the fluteplayer, while the actor merely gesticulatcd in
a suitable manner. This singen was probably the cantor,
who pronounoed the plaudite at the close of the play, and is
referred to in the well-known lines oi Horace : -

Sl plausoris eges aulaea manentis et usque
Sessurl donec cantor ‘Vos plaudite' dicat. (Ars Poct. 154-155.)2

τι The bacehiae verses in the Andria (481-484) have a
weighty air and accord with the professional tone assumed
by Lesbia The soliloquy of Charinus (625 ff.) opens with
a dactylis line, which suggests a dignified seli-restraint, but
this speedily gives way to a passionate outburst of feeling,
well expressed in the broken rhythm oi the sucoeedirig
oretios (626-634).

Of iomhic lines, senarii are, of course, the most suitable

¹'1'hs anolent copies oi Terence designated the cantico with the
sign c., and diverbia with nv. The purely lyrical cantica were marked
rarae, an abbreviation oi mutatis modis cantico. See Hauler-
Dziatzko, ed. ol Phemio, p. 44.
