DIDASCALIA.

The introductory notice, known as a didascalia (διδασκαλία), was a
concise praiaoe concerning the origin and first periorrnance oi a Latin
play. The word isderived from a special use oi the verb διδάσκειν,
which, irom being applied to the Greek dramnic poets who carrata the
actors their parts, came to denota the general work oi preparing ior
the public periormance oi a piace. Didascalico were regularly pre·
pared hy Roman grammarians, such as the famous ht. Terentius Varro
(lla-27 n.c.)‚ who wrote much about the stage. It isnot probablo that
they were inserted in the Mss, of Terence before the augustan age.
