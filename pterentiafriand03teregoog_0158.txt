Hecyra, we learn that the duty was assigned ιο an old man, probably
in both cases Ammvius Turpio.

Since the Andria was the first play which Terence exhibited, and
since this prologue implles a knowledge of the play on the part oi the
critic, it follows either that this prologue was not written for the first
performanoe, or that the actae poeta (line l) had some means oi be-
coming acquainted with the play before ite public presentation. It
lepooeible, of course, that the critic derived his knowledge irem the
recitation before Caecilius (see Introd. § 31), or from the prelirninary
rehearsal before the curule aediles; but Karsten (in hie article Teren-
tiani Prolopill gives several reasons for believlng that the Andria
originally had no prologue, and thet the extant one belongs to asecond
performance. Lines 1-7, 24-28, could hardly have been written by a
hitherto unknown playwright, unless we are prepared to admit that
the young and modest Terence could speak with surprising coniidence
of his own future work, ae well as with uubecoming irony (line 17) of ψ
an older and well-known poet. The aetas poeta knew the Andria,
had definite knowledge of the contaminatio, end must have attached
Terence first (linea 7, 15). Would he have done this before the
Andria was presented in public? Tbe plural, prolopia (line ὃ), points
to the same conclusion, and the lest line finde its eaeiest explanation
iu the Hecyra's failure (165 aa). Karsten assigna this second per-
formance oi the Andria to 162 n.c., the year aiter the Heauton was
successfully ριοᾱοοοᾱ.2 See Introd. ξ 40. note 3.

similarly used. adpulit: adpellere is literally, to drioe, or bring
to, and in Cicero is used only as a nautical term, with or without
narem or a similar word.
