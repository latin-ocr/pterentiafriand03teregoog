0100110000 iniuriosi, aud ai deneget reproducing si nolit. Editors
generally punctuate with a full stop 01 0 001011 aiter nolit ducere.
1⁵6. animum advertenda: in view oi the Mss. inconsistencies aud
uncertainties in the spelling oi uorterc (uertere) and derivatives iu
Terence, it seems well to adhere throughout to the older form uort-.
See the uanior-Dalatako Phormio, p. 583 Lindsay, Lat. Luna, 10461.
16⁷. See App. 154. An easy emendation would be, —

Qui mi exorandust3 et ego spero 06111010.

171. aequor: 11, as seems probable, Simo remalns on the stage,
0001101 is better than sequor. The latter is used in Eua. 908, i prce,
accumbat there the speaker follows immediately. Gandtigivoseqaorffirtffl

· 178. modo: it is not necessary 101 Simo to go within aiter the
first scene to iulorm the household‚ 101 his words in 47 imply that this
bad bcen done before, and lines loti 11. show that Davus had already

. excited hismaster's suspicione. Modo then rciers back to a moment

just before the opening, not 01 sc. 2, but 01 sc. 1. So lion. and Bent.

1⁷5. semper lenitas: several editors (including Klotz, Wog. Meis.)

take semper in an attributive sensewith 1001000, but such a uso, rare

at all times, is quite uncertain 101 Terence. The nearest parallel is

Heaut. 53, Quanrquambaec internos supernotato admodnrnst, where,

however, est is equivalent to sacta est. 1110 case is different with
(eg.) circam itione, 202, where the noun hae 0 strong verbal iorce.

181. interoscitantis: Conradt's conjecture, accepted by Dz. and
Fleclr„ is supported by a 10101110 111 M (Schlee, pp. li, 34).

184. For bem 1110011. now reads em, which is certainly lem appro-
priate here. The difference between the two interjectione is well put
by Kohler, ln Wblfflin’s Archiv, vol. Vl (1881),]110 Partikel err (em),
thus: em accompanies theaction, bem accompanies the succeeding
impression. Α good illustration is 1001οι Ι)0. Hem, quid 0011001
Sr. Em, aide at discidit labrum. Sc here llerrt implies that the speaker
has just noticed Simo. Em is originally tho accusative 01 0 demon-
strative pronoun. (For another derivatim, see Lindsay, Lat. 1000,
p. 617.) The Mss. here show no disagreement, but Kohler (iootnotc,
p. 29) points out that P Cl with A are very trustworthy 111 preserving
the distinction between bem and em.
