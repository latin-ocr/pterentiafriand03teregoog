No Terentiam lis. contains lists oi the amincus personae ior the
uriom plays, but these are gethered from the headings to the different
mensa Some blaa, however, depict at the beginning oi each play the
maaka ιο be used in the representation, the number in the Andria
being thirweu, including the prologue. The arrangement adopted by
editors follows the order oi entrance oi the characters upon the stage,
not, as in modern plays, their relative importante. On the masks, see
Introd„ 546.

One oi the characters in the Andria, viz. Glycerium, is heard only
irom behind the soenes.

The character mmee are all Greek, and while some are etymologi-
cally indicative oi the parts played by their ownera, others probably
have a merely traditional signiticance, derived irom frequent use in the
Neu Comedy. chrunus (χάρις), Pamphilus (πᾶς, φιλέω), and Glyce-
rium (γλυκύς) are all, certainly, appropriate as the names oi lovers,
Crito (spino) naturally settles the point at issue, but itis less easy

. ιο ilud any special significance in Simo, even ii Σῖμον comes from
siais, ,ποι-ηοω, οι· in Chremes, ior we have no reason ιο suppose that
that polite old gentlemau indulgee in uupleasant hawking (χρέμπτομαι)
or neighs like a horse (χρεμετιζω). Moreover, the former name is
used by Plautus in the Mostellaria aud Pseudolus, while the latter is
lound in no iewer thau iour plays oi Terence (Andria, Eunuchus,
Heauton, Phormio), and in one (Eorsuchus) belongs ιο a youth. Not
including the Prologus, the names Sosia, Datus, Pamphilus, Chremen,
crito, aud Dromo are found iu other Terentiun plays, and all oi these,
except crito, are also Plautina. Dromo (the muner) and Byrria
(red-haired) are characteristic slave-names; Sosia (σώζειν) is a freed·
man orsleve of good repnte, while Davus, like Mysis (the Mysiae) aud
Lesbia (tlte wbiaa) has an ethnic name (irom Δᾶοι, the Daciam),
ci. Syrus, Geta, Dorus, Phrygia, all slave-names in other plays.

PROLOGUE.

The prologuee oi Terence are devoted, not ιο au exposition oi the
plot, but mainly to a deience against hostile criticism. They, there-
lore, lie completely outside of the dramatic action. In tho prologue,
the poet suh persona sua, besides replying ιο the attacks oi critias,
appeels to the audieuce ior a iair hearing. The reciter oi the prologus
reas usually ayoung man, though in the case ol the Heauton and the
