90. comperiebam: Fleek, who reads comperibam here and cibat,
030, follows Engelbrecht (Wiener Studien, vol. Vl, 1884, pp. 61011).
Here the longer form may be due to the desire for ὁμοιοτέλευτον. 666
Η611161, Terentiana, p. 21.

103. Either Igitur (omitted by P C B) or 116166 (acre D G E)
before siant must be reiected. But 47 seems to necessitate aerae here.
‘ThIs is onlya pretence of awedding,' Simo has said. ‘Why is not
areal one celebrated i' now aske Sosia. ¹

As to ipitun Wblfflin (Archiv, 161. ΙΙΙ, pp. 660-661)116661161111 that
1116 commonet in Terence‘s earliest plays (Andr. and Eun„ 1116
times each), but is never found iu the Ad, and only once in the Hec.
Perhaps the number fn the earlier plays should be reduced. See
Quintilian, l. 6. 39.

104. 'lhe substance of the note on quibus = post qaam, is dne to
Professor Bennett.

107. ornarent: thus Beni. and Muretus, followed by Meis. Dr.
Fleclr. The Mes. amabant is probably due to amabant, 88.

112. On mibi, tibi, etc, see F. Cramer iu meditaremur Plui-
616ρί6, 161. CLV (1807), p. 101.

116. Birt in Rtein. Murenam, vol. LI (1896), p. 70, derives ctiam
from eti (= ἔτι) and iarn, so that the temporal sense is original. See,
too, Kirk in Amor. Jonr. os Patr, vol. XVIII (1897), p. 26.

quidest? Dz. Spen. Fleck. accept the quid id est of D 11, but
Schlee‚ who in Wblfflin's Archiv, vol. ΙΙΙ (1886), p. 666, advocated id,
now rejects 11 (masam 16111111, 1661, p. 111) secans or
1116 little weight of D here. Μ’ ii

118. 011 anam, see Maixner in Wiener Studien, 161. Χ (1888),
p. 318.

120. 011 this ellipsis Terentiana, see Schoell 111 Bbcin. Murcum,
161. XLIV (1889), p. 284.

145. indipnnrn sueinus: although in 864 these words are governed

by audies, yet here itis more 1116166116 11 116 regard the expression as
an exclamation of Simo's. So Bent. Umpf. Klotz, Meis Dr.; cf
Eun. 70, Pborm. 613, and Quintilian, 6. 12. 12.

154. Theline 16 metrioally faulty; cf. 64. Fieclr. secures a cae-

sura by inserting tibi before locus and reading relietust. We have the
same difficulty in 167 61111417.

1⁵⁵. It 16 decidedly preferable (with Beni. and Klotz) to make this
line the protasis to 166, 161 in the following lines (167, 168), 111 which
Simo expresses his purpose, the protasis and apodosis are practically
repeated, uera obiurgandi causa sit being the equivalent 61 animum
